DANNY: Good morning.
DANNY: Danny_Ocean.
DANNY: As you say, ma am, I was never charged.

###  [Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table.] 
DANNY: My wife left me. I was upset. I got into a self-destructive pattern.
DANNY: She already left me once. I don t think she ll do it again just for kicks.
###  [Glances dart between the Board Members.] 
###  [Danny considers.] 
DANNY: I don t know. How much do you guys make a year?

###  [Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny.] 
DANNY: My wife s.
###  [He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little.] 
DANNY: I m a free man.
----------------------------------------
# 4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4
###  [Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there s not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles The old skin feels good. One last item to don a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?] 
----------------------------------------
# 5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5
###  [A sign reads  NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.  Someone has graffitied below it  If you were in prison, you d be home now.  The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom. The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant Life is hard out there. But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America] 
----------------------------------------
# A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6

----------------------------------------
# 6    INT. CASINO  - NIGHT                           6
###  [And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. As we PULL UP TO Danny s face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS. And to Danny, it s a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He s home.] 
###  [As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips.] 
###  [Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success. He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins. King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts. Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again. A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn t the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome.] 
DANNY: Hello, Frank.
###  [The new dealer glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who s discovered he s dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He quickly hides his astonishment.] 
FRANK: I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See?
###  [He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you ve ever seen. A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both.] 
DANNY: My mistake Table s cold anyway.
FRANK: You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. It gets busy around one.
DANNY: Thanks.
----------------------------------------
# 8   INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND                                          8
###  [Danny checks his watch -- 1258 -- then the lounge around him prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon, folds back the New York Times and scans.] 
###  [His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --  Vegas  Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces Plans  -- accompanied by two photographs The first Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of the Paradiso, Terry_Benedict, with a beautiful woman on his arm. The second scowling former owner, Reuben_Tishkoff.] 
FRANK: Catching up on current events?
###  [Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him, changed out of his dealer s threads.] 
DANNY: Ramon?
FRANK: Glad to meet you. Frank_Catton wouldn t get by the gaming board. You just out?
DANNY: This afternoon.
FRANK: And already turning over a new leaf.
###  [Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.] 
DANNY: You seen him?
FRANK: Last I heard he was in L.A. Teaching movie stars how to play cards. Why? You don t have something planned already?
DANNY: You kidding? I just became a citizen again.
###  [Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye, and Danny can t help but grin of course he has.] 
###  [Frank turns his eyes to heaven] 
FRANK: Jesus

###  [MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.] 
FRANK: It s tough now, our line of work. Everybody so serious. Too many guns, too many computers. Whadda you gonna do? Steal from ordinary people?
DANNY: That would be criminal.
FRANK: So what s left? Banks? Hah. Banks got no money. It s all electronic. Only place that still takes cash is

FRANK: When?

DANNY: Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny_Ocean. I m just out, I m supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. No, sir, I haven t gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir. No, sir, I wouldn t even think of leaving the state.

###  [PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty leaning against his Ford Falcon.] 
TOPHER: Hey! Hey, Rusty!
###  [Rusty turns to the voice and --] 
###  [MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push down a back alley.] 
TOPHER: Hey, I don t know if you re, uh, you know, incorporated or anything, like Rusty_Ryan. And, I don t know, incorporated, but you should think about it, really,  cause I was talking to my manager yesterday --
RUSTY: Bernie?
TOPHER: No, not Bernie, I mean not, not that Bernie, my business manager, he s also Bernie, he was telling me that since this, what we do, could be considered research for, you know, a future gig, that I should be able to write it off as a business expense. So he suggested that it d be better if I wrote you a check, and thereby --
###  [Rusty looks at him are you stoned?] 
TOPHER: Or, or we could keep it cash.
###  [By this time, they should have entered --]

RUSTY: Alright. Who s here?
TOPHER: Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn t make it. He s got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany.
RUSTY: That s a problem.
TOPHER: Barry is here.
RUSTY: I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
TOPHER: Couldn t work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend.
RUSTY: Not the one from --

###  [Small but stylish. Rusty enters, Topher in tow.] 
RUSTY: Good evening, guys. Let s play some cards
###  [A glance at the table reveals the three waiting players are all young TV stars here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. A glance back at Rusty reveals he s in for a long night.] 
RUSTY: and let s play some cards.
###  [The group lesson has begun.] 
TOPHER: A hundred bucks to me Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call.
###  [Rusty leans into Topher s ear, whispering] 
RUSTY: Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you re betting for a reason. Understand?
###  [To another player] 
RUSTY: Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn t change them. Leave  em where they are and make your bet.
###  [To another player] 
RUSTY: You re showing. Yeah, I know she s your girlfriend, Barry, but you can t Thank you.
###  [To another] 
RUSTY: Josh. Deal to your left.
###  [A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with her. As she distributes a fresh round] 
###  [Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table.] 
###  [Rusty checks his hand a full-house full of face cards.] 
RUSTY: You got me. Let s take a little break.
----------------------------------------
# A14   INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB  - NIGHT                              A14
###  [At the bar, Rusty orders a double. He needs it.] 
RUSTY: It s been the longest hour of my life.
RUSTY: I m running away with your wife.
###  [The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away.] 
###  [Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He follows.] 
----------------------------------------
# A15   INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB  - BACK ROOM                          A15
###  [Rusty returns.] 
TOPHER: Hey, Rusty, we got another player, if that s alright.
###  [Topher indicates the new arrival Danny. Rusty looks as if there s a bad smell in the room.] 
RUSTY: What s this?
DANNY: The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I m not intruding.
TOPHER: No intrusion at all --
RUSTY: What was his name, the bouncer s?
DANNY: I don t remember.
RUSTY: A card player with amnesia. This should be fun.
###  [Rusty deals the next hand.] 
TOPHER: What do you do for a living, Mr. Ocean? If you don t mind my asking.
DANNY: Why should I mind? Two cards, please I just got out of prison.
TOPHER: Really? Really
RUSTY: Barry, you re showing again.
DANNY: I stole things.
###  [A beat, then] 
RUSTY: Incan matrimonial headmasks.
###  [Looks are exchanged. Everyone digests that.] 
DANNY: Gallery.
DANNY: Headmasks. Some.
RUSTY: Don t let him fool you, Seth. There s boatloads. If you can move the things One card to me. but you can t.
DANNY: My fence seemed confident enough.
RUSTY: If you re dealing with cash, you don t need a fence.
DANNY: Some people just lack vision.
RUSTY: Probably everybody in cell block E.
###  [Now the other players realize. These guys have a relationship. In fact, a criminal one. And, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one.] 
DANNY: Well, that s all behind us now.
RUSTY: I should hope so.
###  [Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it s not -- then pulls out his wallet.] 
DANNY: I raise you five hundred dollars.
###  [A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet. He and Rusty hold each other s stares.] 
RUSTY: Guys Day One what s the first rule of poker?
###  [Um, never bet on, uh, on  Leave emotion at the a -- door.] 
RUSTY: That s right. My friend here just raised me out of pique. Today s lesson. How to draw out a bluff. This early in the game, that much money, I m thinking he s holding nothing better than a pair of face cards. Seth, raise him.
###  [Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.] 
RUSTY: Tophe
TOPHER: Seven to me. Plus three. What the hell.
RUSTY: Indeed. But be careful you don t push him too high too fast. Want to keep him on the leash. I call.
###  [It s Josh s turn. He hesitates] 
RUSTY: All you have to do is call.
DANNY: What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?
###  [That does it. Josh is in. The bet s to Danny. He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.] 
DANNY: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you re holding three of a kind or better. Five hundred to call. And two grand more.
###  [Danny stares Rusty down. The others look a little pale.] 
RUSTY: Guys, you re free to do what you like. It s a lot of money. But I m staying in. He s trying to buy his way out of his bluff.
###  [Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.] 
RUSTY: We call.
###  [Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It s a winner. The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches.] 
RUSTY: Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing.
###  [As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot.] 
DANNY: Thanks for the game, fellas. Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It s for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.

RUSTY: That was, that was just
DANNY: Unprofessional.
###  [Rusty agrees.] 
RUSTY: How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you?
DANNY: Why do you think I came to see you first?
###  [Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty.] 
DANNY: Ten grand. Half of it s yours.
RUSTY: You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you ve got something better for me.
DANNY: I ve got something better for you.

# 17   INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT                                        17
###  [They re sitting in a booth over coffee.] 
RUSTY: How s Tess?
###  [Danny stares at him next subject, please.] 
RUSTY: Alright. Tell me.
DANNY: It s tricky. No one s ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.
RUSTY: Guns?
DANNY: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There s a lot of security. But the take
RUSTY: What s the target?
DANNY: Eight figures each.
RUSTY: What s. The. Target.
DANNY: When s the last time you were in Vegas?
RUSTY: What? You wanna knock over a casino?

# 19   INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT               19
###  [Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces J.A.] 
###  [Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk s in box to its out box. At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.] 
DANNY: The vault at the Bellagio.
###  [A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it.] 
RUSTY: If I m reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. Oops. Actually, you know what, I m wrong. It s definitely the least accessible vault ever designed.
DANNY: Yep.
###  [Rusty s brow furrows just a little.] 
RUSTY: You said three casinos
DANNY: These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. But every dime ends up here.
RUSTY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and These are Terry_Benedict s places.
DANNY: Yes, they are. Think he ll mind?
RUSTY: More than somewhat.
###  [No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit.] 
###  [As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers the plan .] 
RUSTY: You d need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
DANNY: Like what, you think?
RUSTY: Well, off the top of my head, I d say you re looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. Where do you think you re gonna get the money to back this?
DANNY: As long as we re hitting these three casinos, we ll get our bankroll. Terry_Benedict has a list of enemies.
RUSTY: But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose Aha.
DANNY: Aha.
RUSTY: Reuben.
###  [as he approaches Danny s and Rusty s voices] 
DANNY: So
RUSTY: So, here s what I think You should take this plan, kick it around for a week or two. Sleep on it. Turn it over in your head. Then never bring it up to me again.
DANNY: Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
RUSTY: I m saying this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat.
DANNY: Really? I thought it was much harder than that --
###  [Suddenly the Security Guard s flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light.] 
DANNY: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
DANNY: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.
###  [Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard s hand.] 
DANNY: Preciate it.
###  [Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. When its doors open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.] 
RUSTY: I need a reason. And don t say money. Why do this?
DANNY: Why not do it?
###  [Rusty stares at him enough bullshitting around.] 
DANNY: Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you re colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.
###  [A beat. Rusty smiles.] 
RUSTY: You re been practicing that speech, haven t you?
DANNY: A little. Did I rush it? It felt like I rushed it.
RUSTY: No, it was good.
###  [They step aboard the elevator. As the door closes] 
RUSTY: I wonder what Reuben will say?
###  [Danny and Rusty look at each other.] 
TISHKOFF: You re out of your goddamn minds.

###  [Reuben_Tishkoff, the grimace of a man in mid-movement, forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch guests at his poolside.] 
TISHKOFF: Are you listening to me? You are, both of you, nuts. I know more about casino security than any man alive. I invented it, and it cannot be beaten. They got cameras, they got watchers, they got locks, they got timers, they got vaults. They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris. Okay, bad example
DANNY: It s never been tried.
TISHKOFF: Oh, it s been tried. A few guys even came close. You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history?

TISHKOFF: Second most successful robbery. The Flamingo  71. This guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him.
###  [RESUME ACTION The billy club comes down -- whap! -- across the hippie s skull and it s Chicago  68 all over again.]

TISHKOFF: Outside of Caesar s in  87. He came, he grabbed, he got conquered.

TISHKOFF: But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I m sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you re out the front door, you re still in the middle of the fucking desert!
###  [Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.] 
RUSTY: You re right. He s right.
DANNY: Reuben, you re right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
RUSTY: That s exactly it. Pure ego.
TISHKOFF: Yeah yeah blah blah.
DANNY: Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.
###  [They both rise to go.] 
TISHKOFF: Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I ll never forget it.
DANNY: It was our pleasure.
RUSTY: I d never been to Belize.
TISHKOFF: Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you.
###  [Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. Tishkoff, of course, won t let them go that easily.] 
TISHKOFF: Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob?
###  [Danny stops, almost as if he s been waiting for this question, which of course he has.] 
DANNY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.
TISHKOFF: Those are Terry_Benedict s casinos.
RUSTY: Say, you know, he s right.
###  [Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail.] 
TISHKOFF: You guys Whadda you got against Terry_Benedict?
DANNY: What do you have against him? That s the real question.
TISHKOFF: He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he s gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin  eyesore. Don t think I don t see what you re doin .
RUSTY: What are we doing, Reuben?
TISHKOFF: You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You d hit a guy, he d whack you. Done. But Benedict At the end of this he better not know you re involved, not know your names, or think you re dead. Because he ll kill you, and then he ll go to work on you.
DANNY: That s why we ve got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.
TISHKOFF: Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you re gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. Who do you have in mind?

DANNY: Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.

###  [CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it. Now take a step back That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. It s a remote-controlled toy. The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it an actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race. The drivers stare each other down TURK and VIRGIL MALLOY. They re nice boys. Really. Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.] 
RUSTY: I talked to the Malloys yesterday.
DANNY: The Mormon twins?
RUSTY: They re both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they re having trouble filling the hours.
###  [Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil s toy zips to a lead. It s looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother s vehicle. Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.] 
DANNY: Electronics?
RUSTY: Livingston.

# 34   INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY                                  34
###  [On a black and white monitor Two mobsters, on a meet in a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain no one is watching them. Little do they know Livingston, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN.] 
RUSTY: Livingston s been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad.
DANNY: How are his nerves?
RUSTY: Okay. Not so bad you d notice.
###  [As a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor] 
LIVINGSTON: D-don t, don t-don t touch it.
LIVINGSTON: Do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it?

###  [BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into a dynamited bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound this is bad news.]

# 38   EXT. BANK - ONE MINUTE LATER                                   38

###  [Basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet on the pavement. An explosives COP kneels in front of him.] 
###  [The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.] 
RUSTY: Isn t that right, Basher?
RUSTY: Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a guess. A simple G4 mainliner, double-coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet. That s our man. Tell me something else. Have you checked him for booby traps on his person? I mean really checked, not just for weapons
###  [The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his hands up and down Basher s legs, around his waist, under his arms.] 
RUSTY: Will you go find Griggs and tell him I need to see him?
RUSTY: Just go find him, will you? How fast can you put something together with what I passed you?
RUSTY: From when?
###  [They re hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars, a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.] 
RUSTY: Ten seconds?
RUSTY: Around the corner.
###  [And they both start running.] 
RUSTY: Everyone down! Get down! There s a bomb in the
###  [And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they ve both disappeared.]

A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.] 
###  [A funambulist begins his high-wire act] 
DANNY: So he can walk on a rope.
RUSTY: More than that.
DANNY: So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?
RUSTY: He is the list.
DANNY: Who else?
RUSTY: Watch.
###  [Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is impressed.] 
RUSTY: There s your grease man.

###  [Saul_Bloom, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer s hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off] 
###  [Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves.] 
###  [Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but doesn t turn around.] 
SAUL: I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men s room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.
RUSTY: How ya been, Saul?
SAUL: Never better.
RUSTY: What s with the orange?
SAUL: My doctor says I need vitamins.
RUSTY: So why don t you take vitamins?
###  [For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty.] 
SAUL: You come here to give me a physical?
RUSTY: I got a box seat. Come on.

RUSTY: I thought you drank bloody Mary s at the track, Saul.
SAUL: A man shouldn t drink on the job.
RUSTY: Who we rooting for here?
SAUL: Number four.
###  [There s the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on Saul s eyes never leave the race.] 
SAUL: You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with?
RUSTY: Saul, you re the best there is. You re in Cooperstown. What do you want?
SAUL: Nothin . I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I m seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy s. I ve changed.
RUSTY: Guys like us don t change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don t change.
SAUL: Quit connin  me.
###  [They watch the race.] 
RUSTY: That your hound way in the back there?
SAUL: He breaks late. Everyone knows this.
###  [On the track The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.] 
SAUL: You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is?
###  [Under the noise Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul s ear. Saul s eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. Rusty places an envelope in Saul s lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line last by several lengths. Saul considers his options. In one hand a fan of losing tickets. In the other a ticket to Las Vegas.] 
DANNY: And Saul makes ten.

###  [Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES at a corner.] 
###  [One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young man in a frayed jacket LINUS. Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and consequently they don t notice that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets. The thievery is glacier-paced Linus, his face always forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his target s Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with a flick of his thumb and forefinger. From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss, and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld, lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus. It is Danny, smirk on his lips He is aware of the ongoing heist. Back to Linus, his spoils now in sight, but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when the train hits another curve he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on the Stockbroker s shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet.] 
LINUS: Sorry  bout that.
###  [The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as]

# 51   INT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                   51
###  [The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station.] 
###  [Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no hurry, a man who s pulled this job a thousand times before. He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for a brief brush with one well-dressed man , he escapes the station without incident.] 
----------------------------------------
# 52   EXT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                     52
###  [Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings. And his face falls. All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. On one side, in engraved printing  Danny_Ocean.  On the flip side, in handwriting  Nice pull. Murphy s Bar, Rush & Division.] 
----------------------------------------
# 53   INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER                           53
###  [On a tabletop the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.] 
DANNY: Hi, Linus. Sit down.
LINUS: Who are you?
DANNY: A friend of Bobby Caldwell s. Sit down.
###  [Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.] 
DANNY: Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn t expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
LINUS: That wasn t work, that was practice.
###  [Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table. He keeps his hand over it.] 
DANNY: You re either in or out, right now.
LINUS: What is it?
DANNY: A plane ticket. A job offer.
LINUS: You re pretty trusting pretty fast.
DANNY: Bobby has every faith in you.
LINUS: Fathers are like that. He didn t tell you? He doesn t like me trading on his name.
DANNY: You do this job, he ll be trading on yours.
LINUS: What if I say no?
DANNY: We ll get someone else who won t be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
###  [Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. It s one or the other. A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. Linus is reading it.] 
DANNY: That s the best lift I ve seen you make yet.
LINUS: Las Vegas, huh?
DANNY: America s playground.
###  [And our MAIN THEME KICKS IN as we] 
###  [The city looms out of the desert like an infernal machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon fortress. One thing in particular catches our eye an enormous billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. Below it, a promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call girls.]

LIVINGSTON: Trick or treat.

###  [Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an orange for later.] 
TURK: You make it out to Utah much, Saul?
SAUL: Not as much as I d like.
TURK: You should. You d like it. You d like Provo.
VIRGIL: Anybody see the salsa goes with this?
###  [At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank s astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until] 
DANNY: Gentlemen welcome to Las Vegas.
###  [Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff. He starts down] 
DANNY: Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven t met Linus Caldwell before, he s Bobby s kid outta Chicago.
###  [Linus trades nods around the room.] 
DANNY: Okay. Before we start, nobody s on the line here yet. What I m about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn t sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. Otherwise, come with me.
###  [He turns and walks out of the living room, into another. Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each other over, sizing things up.] 
###  [And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.] 
LINUS: Hi.
TISHKOFF: You re Bobby Caldwell s kid, huh?
LINUS: Yeah.
TISHKOFF: From Chicago?
LINUS: Yeah.
TISHKOFF: It s nice there. You like it?
LINUS: Yeah.
TISHKOFF: That s wonderful. Get in the goddamn room.

# 58   INT. GAME ROOM                                                 58
###  [A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here. Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry_Benedict s Las Vegas three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them. As the eleven surround the table and the model] 
DANNY: Gentlemen the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they re the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas
###  [Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault.] 
DANNY: Gentlemen the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. And we re going to rob it.
###  [Everyone takes a breath, awed.] 
LINUS: Smash-and-grab job, huh?
RUSTY: It s a little more complicated than that.
###  [Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs.] 
DANNY: Courtesy of Frank_Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
###  [On the monitors three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos  cages, moving into the tunnels, then pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault. As the group s glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself] 
DANNY: Okay. Bad news first. This place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos. First we have to get within the casino cages --
RUSTY: -- here, here, and here --
DANNY: -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky the elevator won t move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
RUSTY: -- which we can t fake --
DANNY: -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
RUSTY: -- which we won t get.
DANNY: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
RUSTY: -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft s exit will lock down automatically and we ll be trapped.
DANNY: Once we ve gotten down the shaft, though, then it s a walk in the park just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
###  [Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up The Amazing Yen. In Cantonese. Of course, no one understands him. Except Rusty.] 
RUSTY: No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they d know about it. Anyone else?
###  [Another silence. Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak.] 
TURK: You said something about good news
DANNY: The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we re going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the math.
###  [MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who does it on his fingers. He whistles.] 
RUSTY: That s what I said.
###  [Everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.] 
SAUL: I have a question. Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can t move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can t open
RUSTY: Without being seen by the cameras.
DANNY: Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.
SAUL: Say we do all that. We re just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?
###  [Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one Rusty couldn t deny earlier and these guys won t deny now.] 
DANNY: Yeah.
###  [Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.] 
DANNY: Alright. Here s how we ll begin.

###  [MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at a blackjack table.]

###  [Two security TECHNICIANS on a smoke break grumble about their sex lives. Across the room, Frank sits innocently doing a crossword.] 
DANNY: I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they re from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee
###  [REVEALS On his crossword, Frank has scribbled a transcript of the Technicians  conversation. As he glances up at an electronic keycard clipped to one Technician s belt]

The Malloys, who ve shadowed the guard here, note a sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security camera embedded in the ceiling above No one walks through that portal unchecked.] 
DANNY: Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.
###  [Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino s exit in different directions. They begin to argue The exit s that way -- no, it s that way.]

# 63   EXT. LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD - OUTSIDE THREE CASINOS - DAY          63
###  [With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and, extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it from its perch, so casual about the action that no passerby looks twice at him.] 
DANNY: Second task power. On the night of the fight, we re gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it s your show.
###  [Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him, as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and]

###  [Dozens of monitors manned by dozens of watchers canvas dozens of casino tables; only NASA s control rooms house more technology. Apart from the fray, another bank of monitors manned by two watchers oversee a different section of the casino the cage, its tunnels, the elevator, and the vault it leads to; everything, in fact, which our team saw in the game room.] 
DANNY: Third task surveillance. Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we ll want an eye and ear on them. Livingston

###  [A page of the set Danny and Rusty  borrowed  from Kuehn & Associates. Danny and Livingston study it.] 
LIVINGSTON: Well, it s not the least accessible system I ve seen, but it s close. I don t suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
###  [Danny shakes his head no such luck.] 
LIVINGSTON: Then this is definitely a black bag job. Do they employ an in- house technician?
###  [Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with Livingston s audio-video setup several portable monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.] 
RUSTY: Two. And one of them is lonely.

###  [Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He s flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. No idea.] 
----------------------------------------
# 80   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                               80

###  [The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools, paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share, carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus act in a hardware store.] 
DANNY: We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.
RUSTY: For practice.
DANNY: Something like that.

###  [Outside a window Turk and Virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability. Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal- Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside.] 
FRANK: Oh, I understand perfectly. They are beautiful vans. Well, I thank you for your time, Mister ?
FRANK: Yes, Denham, like a jean. You know you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize?
###  [Frank s not letting go of the man s hand, the object now is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get Frank out of his office.] 
FRANK: I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I m liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in
FRANK: I did. You know they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is I get a reaction to camphor so I can t use traditional remedies
FRANK: That would be lovely.

SAUL: If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won t wake up the following morning.
###  [They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul s eyes never waver.] 
DANNY: You re ready.

# 91   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                         91
###  [Saul s dressed completely now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli] 
SAUL: My name is Lyman Zerga My name is Lyman Zerga
###  [Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.] 
DANNY: There s a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last.

###  [Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE] 
SAUL: My name is Lyman Zerga. I d like a suite, please.
SAUL: I don t make reservations.
###  [A longer glance at Lyman s bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it]

# A93   INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY                        A93
###  [Outside a restaurant s entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.] 
RUSTY: Okay. Tell me about Benedict.
LINUS: The guy is a machine.

# 93    EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY                   93
###  [Terry_Benedict emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.] 
LINUS: He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet s name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.

# 94    INT. BELLAGIO - ELEVATOR BAY                 94
###  [The doors open, and Terry_Benedict steps out. Linus watches from a craps table.]

LINUS: Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager.
RUSTY: What do they talk about?

# 96   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM                     96
###  [Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.] 
LINUS: He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He s fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he s taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He s out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents the day s take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant.
###  [Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio.] 
----------------------------------------
# 97   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - OUTSIDE RESTAURANT                      97
###  [Rusty and Linus watch the entrance No one enters.] 
LINUS: Give him another ten seconds.
###  [Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black portfolio.] 
LINUS: As I said a machine.
RUSTY: And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?
LINUS: Two minutes after they ve been changed, he s got  em in hand. I ll tell you you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy s home and bankrupted --
RUSTY: -- his brother-in-law s tractor dealership, I heard.
LINUS: He doesn t just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met s livelihood.
RUSTY: You scared?
LINUS: You suicidal?
RUSTY: Only in the morning. Now what?
LINUS: Now comes the girl if she comes in after he does, that means they re in a snit.
RUSTY: Where s she come from?
LINUS: The museum downstairs. She s the curator there. Wait here she is. You ll like this.
###  [Rusty looks up as a beautiful woman appears. Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space. And Rusty s face just about drops at the sight of her.] 
LINUS: I don t know if we can use her yet. I haven t even caught her name.
RUSTY: Tess.
LINUS: What?
RUSTY: Her name is Tess.

# 99    INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         99
###  [A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape. Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image to a security tape of the real McCoy. On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil handles.] 
TISHKOFF: This looks familiar. Where d you get this?
VIRGIL: Off your Rolls.
TISHKOFF: Danny! Tell  em not to touch the Rolls!
###  [Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in his hand as the false top to the cash cart before him flies open, revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his watch.] 
DANNY: 2947. Everything okay in there?
###  [Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn t understand him. But Rusty does, appearing behind him.] 
RUSTY: But what doesn t beat the shit out of being a circus performer?
###  [Danny turns to Rusty he looks very, very serious.]

###  [Danny and Rusty adjourn from the warehouse.] 
DANNY: What is it?
RUSTY: Tell me this isn t about her. Or I ll walk off the job right now. Tess. She s with Terry_Benedict now. Tell me this isn t about screwing the guy who s screwing your wife.
DANNY: Ex-wife.
RUSTY: Tell me.
DANNY: It s not. About that. Entirely.
###  [A beat.] 
DANNY: You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren t gonna hurt anybody. We weren t gonna steal from anybody didn t have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That s why I m here.
###  [A beat.] 
RUSTY: Here s the problem we re stealing two things now. And when push comes to shove, if you can t have both, which are you gonna choose? And remember Tess doesn t divide eleven ways.
###  [A beat.] 
DANNY: If things go to plan, I won t be the one who has to make that choice.
###  [The two men stand quietly for a moment.] 
DANNY: How d she look by the way? Tess
RUSTY: I ve seen her happier.
TESS: Radiant  is the word. Absolutely radiant.

# 101   INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - DAY                                101
###  [The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van Gogh and a Monet. At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the seller s AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby. Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands transfixed by the painting.] 
TESS: He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break-up with Fernande Olivier.
TESS: You can see the conflict. He makes her both erotic and grotesque. He s hopelessly drawn to her, and yet she drives him crazy.
TESS: Mr_Benedict is never late.
###  [Just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and Terry_Benedict enters, right on time.] 
###  [He is elegant, beaming, commanding. All that s missing is a blare of trumpets.] 
BENEDICT: Am I late?
TESS: Not at all, Mr_Benedict. Allow me to introduce to you Mr. Jean Santaniello.
BENEDICT: Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I kept you. I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter. I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.
BENEDICT: We hope.
###  [Tess angles Benedict toward the painting.] 
TESS: Here it is.
###  [Benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he catches Tess in his glance, and his smile deepens. Then] 
BENEDICT: Magnificent! I ve been following her for fifteen years now. At last I ve made her a home. All the arrangements and so forth
BENEDICT: Not mine. She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel. Isn t that right, Ms. Ocean?
TESS: Yes, Mr_Benedict.
BENEDICT: She s lovely, isn t she? I can t be the only one who was after her.
BENEDICT: Ah, but this You can t put a price on beauty. But I shouldn t philosophize. I own casinos, after all.
BENEDICT: Of course, of course.
###  [Tess understands she is not to be part of the photo. Benedict and the Seller pose together and Flash!] 
----------------------------------------
# 102   INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - LATER                              102
###  [The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow. Benedict remains, enthralled by the painting. Tess appears beside him.] 
TESS: You like it?
BENEDICT: I like that you like it. I have some bad news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe.
TESS: Oh?
BENEDICT: And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress
TESS: I see.
BENEDICT: He s a charming man, but no one s going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. I ve asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try. I hope you re not too disappointed.
###  [She is, but she buries it.] 
BENEDICT: Are you sure?
###  [She nods, smiles faintly.] 
BENEDICT: I ll see you tonight.
###  [Instinctively she leans in to kiss him. He recoils ever so slightly.] 
TESS: What? We re alone.
###  [He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling, over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. She follows his look.] 
BENEDICT: In my hotels, there s always someone watching.
###  [But he kisses her anyway.] 
TESS: I ll see you tonight.
###  [He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away.] 
BENEDICT: Actually, I do like it.
###  [And Tess remains, thinking he s rich, he s handsome and wooing, but is she happy?] 
###  [thru thru] 
----------------------------------------
# 106    INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM - NIGHT                             106
###  [Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth.] 
SAUL: I don t believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don t believe in questions, either.
###  [This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry_Benedict, on his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT BOSS by the entrance.] 
BENEDICT: Eddie. Anything for me?
BENEDICT: Who is he?
BENEDICT: Zerga? Never heard of him.
BENEDICT: He s staying here?
BENEDICT: How s he doing?
BENEDICT: Good for him

# 107   INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME                           107
###  [Tess_Ocean sits in a booth and sips at a glass of wine and checks her watch Benedict is late or very close to being so] 
###  [when a pair of hands slips over her shoulders and starts to caress her arms.] 
TESS: You re thirty seconds late. I was about to send out a search party Danny
DANNY: Hello, Tess.
TESS: What are you doing here?
DANNY: I m out.
TESS: You re out.
DANNY: Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.
TESS: I don t smoke. Don t sit --
DANNY: They said I d paid my debt to society.
TESS: Funny, I never got a check.
###  [Danny smiles. Tess stares daggers.] 
###  [You can t stay. It s good to see you.] 
DANNY: You re not wearing your ring.
###  [A beat.] 
TESS: I sold it. And I don t have a husband. Or didn t you get the papers?
DANNY: My last day inside.
TESS: I told you I d write.
###  [Danny reaches his hand for hers , but she removes it from the table.] 
TESS: Danny. Go. Now. Before
DANNY: Benedict?
###  [She freezes Danny knows. He smiles it s okay. Then, to a passing waiter] 
DANNY: Whiskey and -- -- whiskey.
TESS: Danny
DANNY: You re doing a great job curating the museum.
###  [She sighs, exasperated.] 
DANNY: The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.
TESS: Remind you of anyone?
DANNY: And I still get Monet and Manet confused. Which one married his mistress?
TESS: Monet.
DANNY: Right. Manet had syphilis.
TESS: They also painted occasionally.
###  [A beat.] 
DANNY: You don t know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
TESS: Did it always go this poorly?
DANNY: Yes.
TESS: Sounds frustrating.
DANNY: You were never easy. Okay. I ll make this quick. I came here for you. I m gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.
TESS: You re a thief and a liar.
DANNY: I only lied about being a thief. But I don t do that anymore.
TESS: Steal?
DANNY: Lie.
TESS: I m with someone now who doesn t have to make that kind of distinction.
DANNY: No, he s very clear on both.
TESS: Nice. Work on that for two years, too?
DANNY: Year and a half.
###  [A light smile from Tess.] 
TESS: Do you know what your problem is?
DANNY: I only have one?
TESS: You ve met too many people like you. I m with Terry now.
DANNY: Does he make you laugh?
TESS: He doesn t make me cry.
----------------------------------------
# 108   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM - SAME TIME                               108
###  [At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank. Benedict approaches, stands off to the right, watching.] 
###  [High Roller turns over a nine. Saul wins.] 
FRANK: Bank wins -- natural nine.
###  [Benedict steps forward.] 
BENEDICT: Mr. Weintraub. How s everything?
BENEDICT: And here I thought you were drinking vodka. Mr. Zerga.
SAUL: Mr_Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.
BENEDICT: You re the guest, sir.
SAUL: And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand?
BENEDICT: I d love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.
SAUL: That s a shame. You re the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.
BENEDICT: No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth.
###  [Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner.] 
SAUL: The fight is Saturday, is it not?
BENEDICT: Yes. I can get you seats
SAUL: No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn t interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.
BENEDICT: I d be happy to put it in the house safe for you.
SAUL: The house safe is for brandy and grandmother s pearls. I m afraid I need something more secure.
BENEDICT: I can assure you, the house safe is utterly
SAUL: I can assure you, Mr_Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now what can you offer me besides the safe?
###  [Saul s eyes are pure steel he is not a man familiar with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.] 
----------------------------------------
# 109   INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME                          109
TESS: See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five years back, Danny?
DANNY: You can t. But what you can do is not throw away another five years.
TESS: You don t know anything about --
DANNY: Listen, you don t love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I ll have to live with that. But not him.
TESS: Spoken like a true ex-husband.
DANNY: I m not joking, Tess.
TESS: I m not laughing. You have to admit there s a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life.
###  [Danny exhales and leans back.] 
DANNY: Yes. But that doesn t mean I m wrong.
###  [She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he isn t. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. He sees her looking at it.] 
TESS: Do you remember what I said to you when we first met?
DANNY: You said you better know what you re doing.
TESS: Do you? Now? Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don t.
DANNY: I know what I m doing.
BENEDICT: What are you doing?
###  [Terry_Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul.] 
DANNY: Catching up.
TESS: Terry, meet my ex-husband
DANNY: Danny_Ocean.
BENEDICT: Mr. Ocean. Forgive me for being late. A guest required my attention.
TESS: Danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me.
BENEDICT: Is that right?
DANNY: I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.
BENEDICT: Of all the gin joints in all the world   You ve been in prison until recently, isn t that right? How does it feel to be out?
DANNY: About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side.
BENEDICT: There s the human condition for you.
TESS: Terry, Danny was just about to
DANNY: I just wanted to say hello. For old time s sake.
BENEDICT: Stay for a drink, if you like.
TESS: He can t --
DANNY: -- I can t.
###  [An awkward silence. Benedict takes Tess s hand in his.] 
BENEDICT: Well, then I don t imagine we ll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.
DANNY: You never know.
BENEDICT: I know everything that happens in my hotels.
DANNY: So I should put those towels back.
BENEDICT: The towels you can keep.
DANNY: Good seeing you, Tess.
TESS: Take care, Danny.
###  [Danny goes. When he s out the door] 
TESS: I m sorry --
BENEDICT: Don t be.
###  [MOVING WITH Danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he saw the mist in Tess s eyes just now, he knows he s got a fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is Linus is tailing him, ten steps back. He stops, glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then continues following Danny.]

###  [Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg. Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles, whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape. There s a KNOCK at the door] 
###  [The maid moves on, on TV A Reporter broadcasts live] 
----------------------------------------
# 112   EXT. PARADISO HOTEL  - DAY                        112
###  [Just down the block from the Terry_Benedict Trinity stands the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben_Tishkoff s bankrupted hotel-casino. A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.] 
###  [Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper reporters, and everyone s smiling and shaking hands, but behind those smiles and under their breaths] 
BENEDICT: Good to see you.
###  [Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring back at her Danny s. She holds his glance a moment -- long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice -- before turning away, to Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and together they all put their hands on  the plunger  and Benedict leans into a microphone] 
BENEDICT: I hope there s as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday s fight.
###  [and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES. Reuben wipes a tear from his eye.] 
----------------------------------------
# 113   INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME                   113
###  [As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights and TV in his room flicker and go out.] 
###  [As he scrambles out the door, making sure to post a  Do Not Disturb  sign] 
RUSTY: Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it.
----------------------------------------
# 114   INT. TISHKOFF'S - GAME ROOM - NIGHT                              114
###  [FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING Ten of our eleven surround the model of the three casinos. Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist] 
RUSTY: Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul s package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we re a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we re committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates.
###  [We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then --] 
----------------------------------------
# 115   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT                                      115
###  [FROM ABOVE, DESCENDING STILL This is the Real Deal. The Bellagio vault. A clock reads 803.] 
RUSTY: Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That s when we make our move
###  [Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault s center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen within, folded neatly.] 
###  [He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes in the room vacant and silent. Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.] 
RUSTY: Okay they ve put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do?
###  [A WIDER ANGLE reveals we re] 
----------------------------------------
# 116   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         116
###  [The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and what we ve been watching has been a trial run. Ten of the eleven watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal.] 
FRANK: Fin says he shorts it.
LIVINGSTON: Make it a sawbuck.
###  [From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor. From this position, he ll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher s covered head-to-toe in sewage.] 
----------------------------------------
# 117   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         117
###  [Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he s saying, that s okay] 
###  [Reuben leans into Livingston] 
LIVINGSTON: I ll explain later.
DANNY: Basher. What happened?
----------------------------------------
# 118   FLASHBACK - INT. VEGAS SEWERS - THAT AFTERNOON                  118
###  [A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of effluent.] 
###  [An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.]

###  [Basher towels off his hair] 
DANNY: So
###  [Danny rises and paces, frustrated. He s come too far for things to go awry now.] 
RUSTY: We could --
DANNY: By tomorrow?
###  [Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair.] 
###  [Danny stops; Rusty looks up.] 
DANNY: What -- is a pinch?

# 120    INT. LAB - DAY                                                  120

###  [Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.] 
DANNY: You two ready?
###  [They nod and, with Danny, start out the van s rear door. Linus starts to follow but] 
DANNY: What are you doing?
LINUS: Coming with you.
###  [Danny smiles and shakes his head.] 
LINUS: But
###  [The van door slams in his face.] 
----------------------------------------

###  [Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the kids  table. Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting has been called to order] 
VIRGIL: Are you a man?
TURK: Yes. Nineteen.
VIRGIL: Are you alive?
TURK: Yes. Eighteen.
VIRGIL: Evel Knievel.
TURK: Shit! Okay, your turn
VIRGIL: Co-sign squared over .0455.
TURK: No. Co-sign squared over .0415.
VIRGIL: .04-five-five.
TURK: One-five.
VIRGIL: You re so wrong.
TURK: You don t know your string theory, bitch.
###  [After a spell of silence] 
VIRGIL: Mom told me she loves me more.
TURK: She told me she was going to tell you that.
TURK: Stop it.
VIRGIL: Make me.
TURK: Stop it.
VIRGIL: Make me.
###  [They can be heard WRESTLING. Linus has had enough. He sneaks out the van s back door without the Malloys hearing him.] 
###  [Linus sulks along the laboratory s perimeter, finds the door Danny pick-locked, and disappears inside. A moment passes. A moment passes. And the next door opens, and Danny, Basher, and Yen appear, pinch in hand -- they ve succeeded. They weave a path to the van] 
----------------------------------------
# 126   INT. VAN                                                       126
###  [Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears. Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back] 
DANNY: We got it. Let s go.
###  [Turk floors it, and they re off.] 
DANNY: Wait a minute.
###  [Turk brakes, and they re not.] 
DANNY: Where s Linus?
###  [Everyone realizes he s not here. Just then SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life. Uh-oh. Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by his side. His eyes scan the compound, then] 
DANNY: There he is.
###  [of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing guards. As he ascends out of sight Danny shifts his focus to -] 
###  [The other side of the building, and two more guards arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase Linus will be trapped.] 
###  [Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side, watching all this. Yen makes a colorful observation about Linus s predicament; of course, no one understands it.] 
VIRGIL: One of us should help him.
DANNY: He knows where we are.
###  [Both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no Linus between them -- he s disappeared.] 
TURK: Where d he go?
###  [Danny and Basher slowly turn Turk and Virgil crouch inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.] 
TURK: What? Would you -- shouldn t someone be behind the wheel?
----------------------------------------
# 129    EXT. LABORATORY - NIGHT                                        129
###  [A second-story WINDOW EXPLODES as a desk chair flies through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.] 
----------------------------------------
# A131   INT. VAN                                                       A131

###  [Linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its windshield.] 
###  [THROUGH the windshield Virgil jabs his thumb over his shoulder get in the back.] 
DANNY: C mon, c mon
###  [Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull him in. Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them slams shut right on Yen s hand -- CRUNCH!] 
YEN: Ahhh!
----------------------------------------
# 131    INT. WHITE VAN                                                  131
###  [as it hurtles away. Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.] 
DANNY: I say stay in the van, you stay in the van, got it?  Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone gets hurt.
LINUS: I got it.
###  [They continue staring daggers at one another as]

###  [Livingston has moved A/V operations into Lyman Zerga s suite. As he scours the same images the watchers downstairs do, he eavesdrops on their communications through his headset.] 
###  [Lost in the luxury his role dictates, Saul floats in a full-sized Jacuzzi and chews on a hundred dollar cigar; Reuben, meanwhile, paces the floor, nervously.] 
TISHKOFF: Where are they? That s what I want to know. Where are they?
SAUL: They ll be here.
TISHKOFF: They ll be here.  Thanks a lot, Fidel.
###  [Punching up a new set of views from the Eye In The Sky, Livingston thrusts forward, alarmed by one.] 
LIVINGSTON: Yikes.
----------------------------------------
# 139   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - LOBBY - DAY                             139
###  [Rusty keeps watch on the hotel s side entrance.] 
###  [He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps the van s roof before it pulls away. As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus, he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.] 
----------------------------------------
# 140   INT. ELEVATOR                                                  140
###  [Riding up] 
RUSTY: You boys have a nice trip?
###  [Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny. Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.] 
LIVINGSTON: We have a problem.
----------------------------------------
# 141   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S LAPTOP - DAY              141
###  [A mug-shot of Danny, complete with vital information height, weight, criminal history.] 
LIVINGSTON: You ve been red-flagged. It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they ll be watching you. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.
DANNY: This is a problem.
###  [A pall falls over the room this is more than a problem, this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise, HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.] 
RUSTY: Saul time to get out.
SAUL: It s time when I say it is.
RUSTY: Now!
###  [We hear HIM JUMP-TO-IT out of the tub] 
SAUL: I m out.
RUSTY: You have any idea how this happened?
###  [Before Danny can answer] 
LINUS: I do. He s been chasing Benedict s woman. Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago. I was tailing you.
DANNY: Who told you to do that?
###  [Before Linus can answer] 
RUSTY: I did. I knew you couldn t leave Tess alone.
TISHKOFF: Who s Tess?
DANNY: My wife.
RUSTY: Ex-wife.
SAUL: Tess is here?
RUSTY: I m sorry. I didn t know if it would sting you, but it did. You re out, Danny.
TISHKOFF: He s out?!
RUSTY: It s that or we shut down right now. His involvement puts us all at risk.
###  [Danny and Rusty face off, furious with each other.] 
DANNY: This isn t your call.
RUSTY: You made it my call. When you put her ahead of us. You made it mine.
DANNY: This is my job.
RUSTY: Not anymore.
###  [Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see everyone in the room is on Rusty s side. Defeated, he stalks out of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down Linus.] 
TISHKOFF: But, but he can t just be out. Who s gonna take his place?
###  [Rusty turns to Linus.] 
RUSTY: Kid, you up for it?
###  [Linus s eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job. He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless he s up for it.] 
RUSTY: Find everyone else. Let  em know the change in plan. Curtain goes up at seven.
###  [Livingston exits. Everyone else in the room staggers about, like witnesses after an execution. Rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but their words cannot be heard.] 
SAUL: Tess is with Benedict now? She s too tall for him.
----------------------------------------
# 144   INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                  144
###  [Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her.] 
BENEDICT: Yes. Yes. No. Very much no. Then inform Mr. Levin he ll find a better view of the fight in front of his television. Surely he must have H.B.O.
###  [Hanging up, Benedict approaches her, puts his hands on her shoulders] 
BENEDICT: What are you thinking about?
TESS: You.
###  [She smiles at him in the mirror. His glance in it, turns from her to himself.]

###  [he steps onto his casino s floor, the king of Las Vegas. The time is 700.] 
###  [Benedict meets his casino Manager, according to schedule.] 
BENEDICT: Any sign of Ocean?
BENEDICT: Put a guy on him. He s here for a reason. I d like to know what it is. But if he comes anywhere near Tess, take it to the next level.
###  [Benedict nods, goes on his way.] 
###  [Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station. From behind, Terry_Benedict approaches, two security guards walking half a pace behind him. Saul spots him in the glass s reflection; he does not turn.] 
SAUL: Mr_Benedict.
BENEDICT: Mr. Zerga. It s a very busy night for me. Are we on schedule?
SAUL: I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My couriers should be here momentarily.
###  [A beat as Benedict studies Saul.] 
BENEDICT: It s a nice evening. Shall we wait outside?
###  [Benedict and Saul emerge, guards positioned around them.] 
TURK: They re in position.
LIVINGSTON: Okay. We re a go.

###  [A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait. Turk_Malloy gets out the passenger s side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver s side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits.] 
TURK: Mr. Zerga. A gift from Mr. Hesse.
###  [Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the cuff on Turk s wrist, transfers it to Saul s, clamps it shut, and hands Saul the key.] 
SAUL: Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.
###  [He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.] 
----------------------------------------
# 151   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO                                          151
###  [Frank deals blackjack to a full table. His eyes gaze past his players to Saul, the guards and Benedict passing by.] 
FRANK: Lookin  like a bad night for the house.
###  [MOVING WITH Benedict as he spies out of the corner of his eye Danny, lurking at a slot machine. To one of his guards] 
BENEDICT: Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean s in the west slots.
###  [The guard goes, and Benedict continues with Saul] 
BENEDICT: I m afraid I can t allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don t mind
SAUL: Of course not.
###  [Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse yet, happens to recognize Saul.] 
###  [Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict notices this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.] 
###  [At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark s eyes.] 
SAUL: Friedrich, Gunther.
###  [An order dispose of this man. Virgil and Turk pick up the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away.] 
SAUL: Mr_Benedict Please I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin.
###  [They proceed.] 
###  [Danny sits in a row of octogenarians, all vacantly dropping $1 coins and pulling levers. As he watches Saul and Benedict disappear into the cage] 
###  [DING! DING! DING! DING! Four cherries. Danny smiles, a big winner, but he s got bigger pots to win tonight. He steers a neighboring senior citizen to his slot machine] 
DANNY: Pops, you won.
###  [then slips away.]

RUSTY: Where you gonna put your hands?
###  [Linus clasps them.] 
RUSTY: No
###  [Linus goes for his pockets.] 
RUSTY: Not the pockets, either. And don t touch your tie. Look at me
###  [Linus does.] 
RUSTY: That how you gonna stand?
###  [Linus shifts his balance.] 
RUSTY: Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look?
###  [Linus looks down.] 
RUSTY: Death. You look down, they know you re lying --
###  [Linus looks up.] 
RUSTY: -- and up they know you don t know the truth. Don t use three words when one will do, don t shift your eyes, look always at your mark but don t stare, be specific but not memorable, funny but don t make him laugh, he s gotta like you then forget you the moment you ve left his sight, and for God s sakes whatever you do, don t under any circumstances --
LIVINGSTON: Rust, can you come here a sec?
RUSTY: Sure thing.

# 155    INT. BELLAGIO CAGES - EMPTY COUNT ROOM                          155
###  [The room is empty save for a large table. Saul places his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination locks, and opens it. Inside the case five rows of glittering emeralds.] 
BENEDICT: They re very beautiful. A gift.
###  [Saul stares at him none of your fucking business.] 
BENEDICT: Can you lift them out, please?
###  [Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case s interior. Saul replaces the tray.] 
BENEDICT: Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material. I further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty-four hour period to store in our secured vault. While I cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault
SAUL: Why not?
BENEDICT: Insurance, for one. Security, another. And I don t trust you.
###  [There is a KNOCK at the door, and Walsh the casino manager enters. He speaks low in Benedict s ear.] 
###  [Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul.] 
BENEDICT: Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my casino manager. If you will allow, he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor. Those are my terms. Yes or no?
###  [Saul and Benedict eyeball each other.] 
SAUL: You leave me no choice.

###  [RISING FROM a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to- side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus Caldwell. He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his nerves. Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes] 
LIVINGSTON: Deep breaths. You ll do fine.
LINUS: Thanks.
LIVINGSTON: No sweat, kid. You re a rock. Now don t fuck up.

# 158   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S MONITOR - NIGHT            158
###  [Linus s smile disappears as he continues to bounce. There s a KNOCK at the door.] 
###  [Rusty checks through the peephole, then ushers in Turk and Virgil in costume with their room service cart.] 
TURK: Who ordered the penne?
###  [Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his plate, Virgil whips off the cart s tablecloth underneath it s the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to a corner.] 
RUSTY: You ready?
###  [In it, Yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods.] 
----------------------------------------
# 159   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - THE EYE IN THE SKY              159
###  [Fat and Slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up, as behind them Walsh, Benedict, and Saul enter.] 
###  [Walsh, finding Fat and Slim as they are, coughs; the two watchers leap immediately to their feet. Benedict checks his watch.] 
SAUL: Don t let me keep you.
BENEDICT: Mr. Zerga
###  [And Benedict takes his leave] 
----------------------------------------
# 160   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                      160
RUSTY: Linus you re up.
----------------------------------------
# 161   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                     161
###  [Linus nods, shakes out his hands some more] 
LINUS: Deep breaths, deep breaths.
###  [and here comes Benedict, exiting the cage just as his assistant arrives with his portfolio. As he turns toward the restaurant] 
LINUS: Mr_Benedict
BENEDICT: Yes?
LINUS: Sheldon Wills. Nevada Gaming Commission. Could I have two minutes of your time?
###  [Benedict sighs -- his evening s been sidetracked enough already -- but] 
BENEDICT: Of course. Anything for the
###  [Danny watches Benedict escort Linus toward the blackjack tables, unaware that TWO PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GOONS watch him from across the bar, and when he turns in their direction, they look away, acting incognito, but it s not them he s turning toward it s Tess, rounding a corner toward the restaurant. Danny jumps to his feet, throws a tip on the bar, and goes.] 
----------------------------------------
# 163   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   163
###  [The time is 727. Yen tucks himself into the cash cart s hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company. Meanwhile, Rusty drills Virgil and Turk] 
RUSTY: Okay when do you make the deposit?
TURK: Not until we get your signal.
VIRGIL: Hey. What do we look like a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something?
###  [No one responds.] 
RUSTY: Amazing how s it feel? You alright? Want something to read? Magazine?
###  [From the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to show Rusty what he can do with a magazine.] 
RUSTY: Okay. I m counting down. Thirty minutes of breathing time starts now.
###  [On  now  a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 2959. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES. Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug it s shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston s penne on the way to the door.] 
LIVINGSTON: You get no tip.
----------------------------------------
# 164   INT. CASINO FLOOR - 28:37                                        164
###  [and counting. MOVING WITH Benedict and Linus into the Pit Boss s station.] 
LINUS: It only came to our attention this morning, Mr_Benedict. Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.
BENEDICT: If he is who you say he is. Charlie. Call over Ramon Escalante.
###  [Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side. While Linus does his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his portfolio.] 
----------------------------------------
# 165   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S MONITOR - NIGHT           165
###  [An overhead view of Benedict as he pulls out the combination to the vault, reads it, then buries it in his jacket pocket.] 
RUSTY: Did you make it out?
LIVINGSTON: His head blocked the last two numbers. We missed it, Linus. You gotta grab the combination yourself.
----------------------------------------
# 166   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                   166
###  [Linus half-nods in response, and Benedict notices. Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.] 
BENEDICT: You new at the commission?
LINUS: Been there about two years.
BENEDICT: I know Hal Lindley over there. You work with him at all?
LINUS: Not since he died last year.
###  [He passes. The Pit Boss returns with Frank in tow.] 
BENEDICT: Mr. Escalante. Would you come with us, please?
FRANK: What s this about?
BENEDICT: I think it s better if we talked off the floor.
###  [Linus and Benedict lead Frank away. As they pass an elevator its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash cart. They leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter uniforms, a tablecloth.] 
----------------------------------------
# 167   INT. RESTAURANT - 24:26                                              167
###  [and counting. A MAITRE D  scours his reservations list, then peers up to find Reuben_Tishkoff approaching, on either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn t give Hefner the time of day.] 
TISHKOFF: Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I would like a table. Something quiet before the fight.
TISHKOFF: Quick as you can. The meter s running here.
###  [The Maitre d  turns to his next customer Tess. She, of course, merits a table instantly.] 
###  [Reuben can t help but stare as Tess passes by. His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low] 
###  [Reuben pivots; it s Danny, and he strolls past Reuben and his lady friends and into the restaurant] 
DANNY: Try to keep your tongue in your mouth.
TISHKOFF: Yeah, pal, well only if you take your thumb out of your
###  [Reuben gets brushed from behind by the two Plainclothes Goons following Danny.] 
TISHKOFF: Hey you have any idea who I think I am?
###  [Just as she s sitting, Danny approaches. She goes straight at him, apoplectic.] 
TESS: Danny No.
DANNY: I ll just be a moment.
TESS: I m having you thrown out of here.
###  [She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and she wheels on him.] 
TESS: You re up to something, Danny. What? And don t say you came here for me. You re pulling a job, aren t you?
DANNY: Tess
TESS: Well, know this no matter what it is, you won t win me back. I can t afford it.
DANNY: I just came to say good-bye.
###  [This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.] 
TESS: Oh then good-bye.
DANNY: Good-bye.
###  [Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it s alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it] 
DANNY: Be good.
###  [Danny leaves her. Tess watches him go.] 
TESS: Good-bye, Danny.
###  [Danny runs smack into the Plainclothes Goons.] 
DANNY: I thought he might.
###  [The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past Reuben who frowns, concerned.] 
----------------------------------------
# 170   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO MANAGER'S OFFICE - 18:25                    170
###  [Frank stands at attention before Linus and Benedict. Linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him. Benedict checks his watch the fight s opening bell is growing closer and closer.] 
LINUS: Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Escalante. Or should I call you Mr. Catton?
###  [Frank bristles, tries not to let it show. Linus pulls out a Xeroxed mug shot and bio of him.] 
LINUS: You are Frank_Catton? Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system?
LINUS: Your silence suggests you don t refute that. Mr_Benedict, I m afraid you ve been employing an ex-convict. As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids
FRANK: Goddamn cracker
LINUS: Pardon me.
FRANK: You heard me. Just  cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state
LINUS: That has nothing to do with
FRANK: some cracker cowboy like you s gotta kick him out on the street. Want me to jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, won t let me deal cards, might as well call it whitejack.
LINUS: I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this. Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored I mean
###  [That does it Frank attacks Linus, lunging at the man, and as Benedict steps in to separate the two] 
###  [Linus s hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and withdraws the vault combination.] 
FRANK: Okay, okay, I m cool.
BENEDICT: You alright?
LINUS: Yeah.

# 171   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                      171
RUSTY: He s got it. Virgil, Turk deliver your package.
----------------------------------------
# 172   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - 14:05                     172
###  [Two guards stand sentry outside the cage door. Virgil and Turk move up with their cash cart, and when Virgil reaches for his keycard it s gone.] 
VIRGIL: Aw, I think Jesus. I lost my card.
###  [The guards frown at him. A SECURITY OFFICER approaches.] 
VIRGIL: I think Jesus! I lost my keycard.
###  [The sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the cash cart. Turk and Virgil hesitate a moment to watch it enter, then hurry off.] 
----------------------------------------
# 173   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  173
###  [On a monitor The sentry pushes the cart down a cage corridor. On another Saul s briefcase is escorted by another guard to the vault elevator. On another Danny is escorted inside the cage by the Plainclothes Goons.] 
SAUL: Wonderful.
###  [The yen-filled cash cart joins Saul s briefcase on the elevator. PULL OUT to]

# 174   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - 11:19                                      174
RUSTY: That s my cue. Give Basher the go.
LIVINGSTON: Bash, what s your status?
----------------------------------------
# 175   EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - MOVING WITH BASHER - NIGHT          175
###  [driving the white van, listening to a books-on-tape of Jane Eyre.] 
LIVINGSTON: Bash!
LIVINGSTON: What s your status?
###  [And he SCREECHES to a halt on the parking structure s top level. Vegas can be seen in every direction.] 
----------------------------------------
# 176   INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - 08:36                                        176
###  [and counting. Benedict exits the casino Manager s office with Linus and Frank. Benedict hails two GUARDS] 
BENEDICT: Please show this man off the premises. Don t step foot in my casino again.
FRANK: Cracker.
###  [Benedict checks his watch again he s really running late.] 
BENEDICT: Mr. Wills, if you don t mind Mr. Wills?
LINUS: Of course.
###  [They start toward the exit. But halfway there] 
LINUS: My beeper. I m sorry. I forgot it.
###  [Benedict hesitates He s in an enormous hurry now, he s behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it.] 
BENEDICT: You know how to get back out?
LINUS: Of course. Enjoy the fight.
BENEDICT: Thank you.
###  [Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man.] 
----------------------------------------
# 177   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - 06:47                                      177
###  [and counting. The Guards show Frank out. Frank tries to tip them] 
FRANK: Thanks, fellas.
###  [but they snarl at him before returning inside. Frank smiles and goes on his way, his job complete.] 
----------------------------------------
# 178   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - 06:36                                   178
###  [Danny sits opposite two Plainclothes Goons in absolute silence, waiting.] 
DANNY: How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be?
###  [He scans the room.] 
DANNY: No cameras in this room, huh? Don t want anyone seeing what happens here?
###  [The Goons say nothing. Danny checks his watch.] 
DANNY: He s not coming, is he?
###  [The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their bluff.] 
DANNY: Who is?
###  [There s a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile Danny s about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher in the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny Ocean. The guy s at least six-six, three hundred pounds, but it s not his size that draws attention, it s his teeth] 
###  [or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn t hold a single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum city. And there s something really terrifying about the sight.] 
DANNY: I guess Mr_Benedict didn t like me talking to his girl.
###  [The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.] 
###  [The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser s fist flashes out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little blood from his lip.] 
DANNY: Jesus, Bruiser, not  til later.
DANNY: S okay. How s the wife?
DANNY: Then we better get to work.
###  [Standing guard outside, the Goons hear PUNCHES and GROANS from inside as]

###  [A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought -- plants Saul s briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an unforeseen obstacle to Yen s escape.] 
----------------------------------------
# B181   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                              B181

----------------------------------------
# 181    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 04:30                           181
###  [Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction.] 
SAUL: Yes, I m very satisfied.
###  [On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks anything but satisfied. He s sweaty, his mouth s so dry he can t swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets for his Rolaids, without finding them.] 
----------------------------------------
# 182    INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH LINUS - 04:02                   182

# 183    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                      183

LIVINGSTON: Almost there, kid.
----------------------------------------
# 184    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  184
###  [and Saul spots him, but so does Fat] 
###  [and Saul can t handle the suspense He grips his arm and groans and this is no ulcer problem, this is a full- fledged cardiac, and Walsh, Fat, and Slim all attend to him, their backs turned as] 
----------------------------------------
# 185   INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - 03:42                                 185
###  [Linus hurries to the elevator, punching Benedict s combination into a keypad. The elevator doors open for him.]

# 186   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                     186

LIVINGSTON: Going to video now.
----------------------------------------
# 187   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                 187
###  [As Saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight, a security monitor flips from a shot of Linus entering the elevator to a Livingston-fed videotape of an empty lift.] 
----------------------------------------
# 188   INT. ELEVATOR - 03:15                                          188
###  [Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator s ceiling, rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. As he starts to push it open a hand yanks it free from above. It s Danny.] 
DANNY: You didn t really think I was gonna sit this one out, did you?
LINUS: What, didn t you trust me?
DANNY: I do now.
###  [He reaches down and pulls Linus, wide-eyed, up to the roof of the elevator.] 
----------------------------------------
# 189   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA - 3:00                             189
###  [The boxers enter the ring before a full, cheering house. Benedict and Tess find their ringside seats, a row in front of Reuben and his  nieces.] 
----------------------------------------
# 190   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - 02:56                    190

RUSTY: Someone called for a doctor?
----------------------------------------
# 191    INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE ELEVATOR - 02:21                    191
###  [Danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling line wrapped around his torso. Linus does the same.] 
LINUS: How d you get here?
DANNY: Crawlspace. And I had to give away a couple mil.
LINUS: But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty
###  [Danny just smiles at him.] 
----------------------------------------
# A192   FLASHBACK - EXT. MIRADOR SUITE - BALCONY                        A192
###  [Earlier that night, just after Rusty kicked Danny off the job. As Linus watches from inside, deaf to their conversation, blind to their expressions, Danny and Rusty confer.] 
DANNY: You think the kid bought it?
RUSTY: Hell, I think Reuben bought it, and he knew we were screwing around. You sure about this?
DANNY: Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time. Least I could do is give his kid a push.
----------------------------------------
# B192   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE ELEVATOR                   B192
LINUS: Why d you make me go through all this? Why not just tell me?
DANNY: Well, where s the fun in that? C mon Yen s got about three minutes of air left.
###  [Danny leads Linus down and around the elevator and side- by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator, gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from falling. Meanwhile, we DESCEND QUICKLY DOWN the shaft, just to illustrate how very high up they are.] 
----------------------------------------
# 192    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 00:53                              192
###  [Rusty, playing doctor, inspects Saul. At the same time, he inspects a monitor the vault door closing with the Yen-filled cash cart and Saul s briefcase inside. Rusty stops, listens to Saul s chest, then drops his head] 
RUSTY: He s gone.
###  [Walsh, Fat and Slim all bow their heads. At the door, two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.] 
###  [The first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes him] 
VIRGIL: I told you to hurry.
----------------------------------------
# 193    INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BELOW ELEVATOR - 00:42                       193
###  [As Danny and Linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors to their rappelling lines] 
DANNY: Who do you like tonight?
LINUS: Huh?
DANNY: Tyson or Lewis.
LINUS: The fight ? Lewis. You like Tyson? How strongly do you feel about it?
DANNY: You looking for action?
LINUS: I d go in for a buck.
DANNY: A buck it is.
###  [And they re ready, poised at the top, looking into the abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared sensors.] 
DANNY: Livingston, we re set.
----------------------------------------
# A194   INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES                                A194

# 194    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - 00:21                                       194
LIVINGSTON: Basher, we re set.
----------------------------------------
# 195    EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - 00:17                    195
LIVINGSTON: We don t have a minute. Yen s gonna pass out in thirteen seconds.
###  [And Basher leaps down to hook up the pinch s wires to his van s engine.] 
----------------------------------------
# 196   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA - 00:10                            196
###  [The opening BELL RINGS -- round one. The fighters break from their corners, feinting, jabbing Sitting ringside Benedict looks at Tess and smiles as she winces at the first sharp blow.] 
----------------------------------------
# 197   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BELOW ELEVATOR - 00:05                   197
###  [Peering down into blackness, Danny and Linus prepare to let go any moment] 
LINUS: You ever rappelled before?
DANNY: Never. You?
LINUS: Nope.
----------------------------------------
# 198   EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - 00:01                  198
###  [Basher finishes preparations.] 
LIVINGSTON: Then hit it.
###  [Basher flips the switch. BOOM! A quick TREMOR, then stillness. He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe Ruth, and suddenly] 
###  [whole blocks of lights disappear. Casinos vanishing one- by-one.] 
###  [Every pink light vanishes.] 
###  [The fountain goes flaccid.] 
###  [The roller coaster stops dead; its passengers keep their arms raised, not sure what to do.] 
###  [Both fighters move in simultaneously, sweat flying, both reach back, both going for the lights-out power cut to the jaw, when lights out.] 
----------------------------------------
# 202   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT                                           202
###  [Blip -- out go the infrared sensors.] 
DANNY: Now!
###  [And he and Linus lean forward and fall] 
###  [DOWN the elevator shaft. Upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the WHOOSH of their bodies in motion and the WHIRL of their CORDS] 
###  [And now, looking STRAIGHT DOWN, the ground is rising up fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty] 
###  [And SNAP -- the CORDS reach their full extension, and Danny and Linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.] 
LINUS: Aaaaahhhhh!
----------------------------------------
# 204   EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - NIGHT                   204
###  [In the distance, lights come up again, first at the Mirage, then the MGM, gradually approaching] 
----------------------------------------
# 205   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM                                    205
###  [Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils straight across. He and Linus go tumbling to the floor as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their elevator anchors, just before the infrared lights go back on-line.] 
----------------------------------------
# 206   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA                                     206
###  [The lights suddenly flash back on, revealing both fighters standing, and Tyson takes advantage of Lewis s disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his jaw. Down goes Lewis, and up goes the crowd, roaring.] 
###  [Benedict makes a quick survey; the arena is apoplectic from the blackout-knockout.] 
BENEDICT: What the hell was that?
###  [He cranes his neck, looking around the room, surveying his empire he smells a rat. His eyes fall on Reuben behind him, but Reuben just shrugs  I didn t pull the plug.] 
BENEDICT: The first goddamn round.
----------------------------------------
# 207   EXT. BELLAGIO PARKING LOT - TOP LEVEL - NIGHT                  207
###  [All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his achievement with great pride, his job complete.] 
----------------------------------------
# 208   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM                                   208
###  [Linus and Danny arise from where they ve fallen, clutching their heads and rubbing bruises. Danny doesn t recover as quickly.] 
LINUS: You alright?
DANNY: No, but you re sweet to ask.
----------------------------------------
# 209   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT                                            209
###  [Lights are just flickering on here when the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward slightly. It s Yen trying to get out, out of air and only now alert to Saul s heavy case resting atop him.] 
----------------------------------------
# 210   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                     210
###  [Livingston watches this on his monitors, just coming back on, his finger poised on a play button, as Frank comes in the door.] 
FRANK: Are they in?
LIVINGSTON: One second. I thought you got kicked out?
###  [Frank shrugs. Suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself, and Livingston presses play.] 
###  [Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty. And of the vault itself Yen trying to get out of the cash cart.] 
###  [Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor the three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty and in totally different positions. Of the vault no cash cart, but no Zerga briefcase, no Yen.] 
LIVINGSTON: LIVINGSTON: This tape s from last night. Same guards, same
###  [His eyes fixing on Saul s briefcase pushing closer to the edge of the cash cart as Yen tries to free himself.] 
LIVINGSTON: shift.

# 211   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               211
###  [The room is abuzz with activity. The monitors here flicker back on, too, displaying the images from monitor B, but every watcher in the place is watching a table because] 
----------------------------------------
# 212   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                 212
###  [the floor is going nuts. After the ten seconds of darkness, all bets are off. Some players doubled-down during the blackout, others miraculously halved their bets. Consequently, Livingston s video feed switch goes unnoticed.] 
----------------------------------------
# 214    INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT                                     214
###  [Danny and Linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze out. Just beyond the next doorway stand three UZI-CARRYING GUARDS, hovering outside the vault door and wondering what the hell just happened to the lights.] 
----------------------------------------
# A215   INT. VAULT                                                      A215
###  [Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the more he pushes, the more Saul s briefcase slides off. Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it s slid beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.] 
----------------------------------------
# B215   INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT                                     B215
###  [The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.] 
###  [Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three- count before THUD, THUD, THUD. They peer around the corridor to find All three Uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the ground. Linus starts in, Danny holds him back] 
DANNY: Not yet. Okay.
----------------------------------------
# 216    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                             216
###  [Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards  bodies.] 
LINUS: You think Yen made it out okay?
DANNY: I m sure he s fine.
----------------------------------------
# A217   INT. VAULT                                                  A217
###  [Saul s briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now. Yen s hand stretches farther out to grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until the briefcase tumbles toward the floor but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to it and swings it round. He s got it. That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath of his life.] 
----------------------------------------
# B217   INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                         B217
###  [Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom . He steps back as it slides open, revealing -- -- the vault door it is sleek and immense and impregnable.] 
LINUS: Jesus
DANNY: There s a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door. Let s get him out.
###  [Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.] 
----------------------------------------
# 217    INT. VAULT                                                  217
###  [Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul s briefcase opened beside him . He hears the muffled Danny s slaps and he knows it s time for his leap. It s the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session, but this time he s only got one good hand.] 
----------------------------------------
# 218    INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                          218

LIVINGSTON: No bet.

###  [Yen prepares for his leap, then springs across the room, to the ledge he must grab and he grabs it, but with only one hand he s slipping right away, and in a second he ll hit the sensored floor but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs, propping himself up between two walls, inches above the floor. An acrobatic wonder.] 
----------------------------------------
# 220   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                           220
###  [Frank and Livingston exhale.] 
LIVINGSTON: Shit.
###  [Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door again. A moment passes, then Yen responds with a slap, too.] 
DANNY: Okay.
----------------------------------------
# 222   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   222
###  [As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator.] 
FRANK: That s it?
LIVINGSTON: There s still the five pins and the floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. But from this side
###  [He punches up the image of Yen in the vault.] 
----------------------------------------
# 223    INT. VAULT                                                     223
###  [Yen sets the last of Lyman s emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive which, of course, it is. He affixes a detonator receiver to it, then slaps the door twice all set.] 
###  [Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault door.] 
DANNY: Counting down from twenty -- -- now.

# B224   INT. VAULT                                                     B224

DANNY: -- seventeen, sixteen, fifteen --

###  [Yen tries to free himself, but he can t use his other hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a plastic explosive.] 
DANNY: -- eleven, ten, nine --
----------------------------------------
# F224   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                             F224
###  [Livingston et al. are alert to the danger.] 
LIVINGSTON: Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not blow the door, you re about to kill Yen.
###  [Linus hears nothing through his earpiece.] 
LINUS: -- five, four, three --

# H224    INT. VAULT                                                     H224

DANNY: -- one --

###  [Yen, still on the door, remains frozen. Trembling. A beat. Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he can get.] 
###  [Danny presses it again. Still nothing.] 
LINUS: What s wrong?
DANNY: I don t know.
###  [Linus comes over to look.] 
LINUS: You check the batteries?
###  [Danny blanches. Linus shoots him a look.] 
----------------------------------------
# 224    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                       224

SAUL: Everything going okay?
----------------------------------------
# 225    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT                              225
###  [As Danny checks his batteries , Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards  gear for replacements. He finds AA s in their flashlights.] 
LINUS: You know, you lose focus for one second in this game --
DANNY: -- and someone gets hurt, yeah yeah. I don t hear Yen complaining.
###  [He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator, then slaps the door twice more.] 
----------------------------------------
# A226   INT. VAULT                                                       A226
###  [Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the line of fire.] 
###  [Danny presses the detonator.] 
----------------------------------------
# C226   INT. VAULT                                                       C226
###  [The  EMERALDS  EXPLODE.] 
###  [Several MUTED but powerful BLASTS. Linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment, pauses] 
DANNY: Do it.
###  [Linus pulls and the door opens.] 
----------------------------------------
# 226    INT. VAULT                                                  226
###  [Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.] 
DANNY: Amazing?
###  [Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone.] 
YEN: Where the fuck you been?
----------------------------------------
# 227    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                  227
###  [Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor. Smiles all around.] 
SAUL: Ever been in love?
FRANK: No, I guess not. Not really.
SAUL: This is better.
----------------------------------------
# 228   INT. CASINO - OUTSIDE FIGHT ARENA                              228
###  [Rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the fight arena. He dials his cell phone, listens] 
----------------------------------------
# 229   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA                                    229
###  [MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out through the crowd. A PHONE is RINGING nearby again and again] 
BENEDICT: You gonna answer it?
TESS: I don t have a cell phone.
###  [They keep moving, but the RING pursues them. Finally, Benedict stops, pulls Tess s purse from her shoulder and opens it inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING.] 
TESS: It isn t mine.
BENEDICT: See who s on the other end.
###  [She takes the phone, activates it.] 
TESS: Hello?
RUSTY: May I have a word with Mr. Benedict, please?
###  [Tess looks up, confused.] 
TESS: It s for you.
###  [Benedict takes the phone.] 
BENEDICT: Who the hell is this?
###  [in the distance, at the arena s exit, unseen by Benedict or Tess, on the phone] 
RUSTY: The man who s robbing you.
----------------------------------------
# 230   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               230
###  [Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. And, of course, Tess. As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps the cell phone pressed to his ear.] 
BENEDICT: What the hell is going on down there in the vault?
BENEDICT: Show me.
###  [Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor and vault -- Livingston s tape.] 
BENEDICT: I m afraid you re mistaken.
----------------------------------------
# 231   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   231
###  [Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston s shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker.] 
RUSTY: You re watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching.
###  [Livingston punches in numbers] 
----------------------------------------
# 232   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY -             232
###  [New images suddenly appear. Three masked men in the vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor. The security center, understandably, erupts in activity.] 
BENEDICT: Jesus Christ
----------------------------------------
# 233    INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                   233
###  [Rusty strolls so casually there s no reason anyone passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a pizza.] 
RUSTY: In this town, your luck can change just that quickly.
----------------------------------------
# 234    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER                                  234
BENEDICT: Find out how much money we have down there.
###  [Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious how did that cell phone get into her handbag? And suddenly it hits her] 
----------------------------------------
# A235   FLASHBACK - INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT EVENING             A235
DANNY: Good-bye.
###  [Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it s alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it as he slips the cell phone into her handbag, unnoticed.] 
BENEDICT: Alright. You ve proved your point. You ve broken into my vault. Congratulations you re a dead man.
###  [Tess leaves.] 
RUSTY: Maybe.
BENEDICT: May I ask how do you expect to leave here, hmm?
----------------------------------------
# 235    INT. CASINO FLOOR                                              235
BENEDICT: ###  [Do you believe I ll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors? A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages. She stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him.] 
RUSTY: ###  [No. You re gonna carry it out for us.] 
BENEDICT: ###  [And why would I do that?] 
RUSTY: ###  [Take a closer look at your monitor] 
----------------------------------------
# 236   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         236
###  [Benedict does. As the three masked men stuff money into large canvas bags and mark the bags with X s, another portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped.] 
RUSTY: As your manager s probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight.
###  [And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh approaches with the night s cash count $163,156,759.] 
RUSTY: You may notice we re only packing up about half that. The other half we re leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage.
----------------------------------------
# 237   INT. CASINO FLOOR                                            237
RUSTY: You let our eighty million go, and you get to keep your eighty. That s the deal. You try and stop us, we ll blow both cash loads.
###  [He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess. She stares at him directly she knows.] 
RUSTY: Mr_Benedict you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly. It s your decision.
###  [He cups the phone.] 
RUSTY: Hi.
----------------------------------------
# 238   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                           238
###  [Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage. He knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches. He makes his choice] 
BENEDICT: Make the call.
###  [Walsh grabs a phone, punches numbers] 
----------------------------------------
# 239   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                     239

# 240   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                           240

# 241   INT. CASINO FLOOR                                              241
###  [Tess and Rusty hold a stare as Rusty holds the phone.] 
TESS: Where s Danny?
RUSTY: He s fine. He wants you to go upstairs, and watch TV.
TESS: He does?
BENEDICT: You have a deal.
RUSTY: It s alright, Tess. I promise. Good. Here s what you do. Five minutes from now, the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator.
###  [Tess isn t sure what to do. As Rusty continues on the phone, she backs off, debating can she blow the whistle on her ex?] 
----------------------------------------
# 242   INT. VAULT ELEVATOR - CLOSE ON SIX CANVAS BAGS                 242
###  [each sealed tight, each marked with an X, loaded onto the vault elevator.] 
RUSTY: If they meet anyone, we ll blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault.
----------------------------------------
# 243   INT. CAGE - OUTSIDE VAULT ELEVATOR                             243
###  [A small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault elevator. Its doors open to reveal the six large canvas bags, each sealed tight, marked with an X.] 
RUSTY: One minute after that, the elevator will rise to your cages. Six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino.
###  [Six guards do precisely that.] 
----------------------------------------
# 244   INT. CASINO - NIGHT                                             244
###  [MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines] 
RUSTY: If they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if there s any indication a switch has been made, we ll blow the money in the vault and the money in the bags.
###  [A SLOT MACHINE RINGS behind him] 
----------------------------------------
# 245   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  245
###  [and Benedict hears it.] 
BENEDICT: He s in the casino right now.
RUSTY: Of course, I m in the casino. In fact, I m staying in your hotel. And I have two words for you mini-bar. Now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor
----------------------------------------
# 246   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    246
###  [The six guards appear from the cage door, carrying six canvas bags marked with X s; Bellagio security escorts them from the building.] 
RUSTY: a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station.
----------------------------------------
# 247   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    247
###  [The white VAN IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the driver s identity inscrutable. It is swarmed by security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.] 
RUSTY: Your guards will load the bags into the van s rear. If anyone so much as approaches the driver s door, we blow everything.
###  [The guards carry out the money and load it into the van s rear. There, they find a video camera mounted within the back seat of the van monitoring them. Still they cannot catch a glimpse of the driver. They close the van doors.] 
###  [The white van departs the valet station in front, clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. Meanwhile, behind the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.] 
BENEDICT: Now what?
RUSTY: Now, when I get word that the van hasn t been followed, that the money is secure, my men will exit the building, and once their safety is confirmed, you ll get your vault back.
----------------------------------------
# 249   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               249
###  [Walsh mouths to Benedict  SWAT team is here.  Benedict nods and throws him a thumbs-up.] 
BENEDICT: Sir, I have complied with your every request, would you agree?
RUSTY: I would.
BENEDICT: Good. Now I have one of my own.
RUSTY: Yes?
BENEDICT: Run and hide. If you get picked up next week buying a $100,000 sports car in Newport Beach, I ll be supremely disappointed. Because I want my people to find you. And rest assured when they do, they won t hand you over to the police. Run and hide. That s all I ask.
###  [And during the above rant by Benedict, we view] 
###  [now empty, Livingston s monitors still displaying the masked men in the vault.] 
###  [navigating the streets of Las Vegas.] 
###  [tailing the van, security goons piled into each, and maybe we NOTICE the Rolls-Royce tailing them.] 
###  [pacing in Benedict s suite, biting her nails, debating whether to blow the whistle on Danny. ON TV a newscast of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight.] 
###  [bound and unarmed, unconscious to the activity within the vault.] 
###  [opened and unmanned.] 
###  [listens -- the line has gone dead. He hangs up.] 
BENEDICT: Get everyone in position. I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.
###  [LONGER MONTAGE now, CUTTING BETWEEN] 
###  [hustling through the cage corridors, armed to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision guards they re as faceless as storm troopers.] 
###  [as it approaches McCarren Airport.] 
###  [The three masked men pace beside the booby-trapped money.]

----------------------------------------
# 261   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  261
###  [The monitors here go black as well. Benedict listens closely to the SWAT frequency.] 
###  [A brief SPURT of GUNFIRE, then BARRROOOOOOM! Dead silence in the Eye in the Sky. Slim stares deep into a monitor s dark pitch. Then] 
###  [Fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors visions of destruction down below smoke fills the vault as two SWAT members push through it other SWAT members help evacuate the unconscious guards] 
BENEDICT: What s the situation down there?
BENEDICT: Tell them to take the van. I m going down there. Find out how they fiddled with our cameras.
###  [262 EXT. McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT 262 As the white van arrives at a charter airline s entrance, the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons emerging, weapons drawn.]

The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver s door, and yanks it open Inside There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time an enormous antenna sprouting from the van s rear bumper. The van suddenly lurches.] 
###  [complete with a tiny video monitor and a steering mechanism -- it s a near- replica of the one Virgil_Malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother. And Virgil s using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben s Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van.] 
TISHKOFF: Enough monkey business.
###  [Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a distinctive red button on his remote.]
