# INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1
###  [In a photographic DARKROOM old optical enlargers, porcelain trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry. GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his seventies.] 
MATLIN: Is he real? Oh yeah Absolutely.
###  [Super CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.] 
MATLIN: I haven t talked about it for years, you know? Everyone called me crazy
###  [Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.] 
MATLIN: But I have the negative.
###  [Someone turns on the darkroom s red safety light for an eerie, dramatic effect.] 
MATLIN: It all started back in ï¿½44. I was a Corps photographer aboard an allied submarine
----------------------------------------
# INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT
###  [YOUNG MATLIN s hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, again under a red light. Now, at 21, he s wedged in a submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges. 35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.] 
###  [SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform soaked in sweat.] 
###  [Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small]

# INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT
###  [Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman  reading  an ancient set of Tarot cards.] 
###  [TREVOR  BROOM  BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the cards face up THE FOOL, THE MOON] 
###  [Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much like a carpenter s tool box.] 
BROOM: This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
###  [He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets. Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT] 
----------------------------------------
# INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT
###  [Super OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND. It s raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain. Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside Broom.] 
BROOM: Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
BROOM: In private, if you don t mind
----------------------------------------
# EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS
###  [They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the small box. It s full of rosaries.] 
BROOM: Your men They ll need these
###  [Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ contemplates the scene from above.] 
BROOM: Amongst other things, yes but that s hardly the point.
###  [Whitman locks and loads an automatic.] 
BROOM: I abhor violence. Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don t think me mad
###  [He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ It has no eyes.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. DITCH
###  [MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the move. Broom catches up with Whitman.] 
BROOM: Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other
BROOM: Paranormal  But you read the transmission.
BROOM: I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
###  [Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he sees lights.] 
MATLIN: Sweet Jesus.
###  [Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS swarm among thick stone walls and archways.] 
BROOM: They must be here for the sheep.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT
###  [A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask KROENEN.] 
BROOM: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich s top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. NEARBY - BROOM - NIGHT
###  [He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.] 
BROOM: If he s here, this is worse than I thought.
###  [The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.] 
BROOM: We don t have forty minutes.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
###  [Kroenen throws a switch On the machine, dozens of gears respond! Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and signals for more floodlights to be turned on.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT
###  [The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully extended.] 
GRIGORY: No matter what happens to me, you must carry on with the work.
###  [ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.] 
ILSA: I will not leave you.
GRIGORY: Yes, you will Leave me. Deny me.
ILSA: Never
###  [He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand- drawn notes and illustrations.] 
GRIGORY: This will guide you back to me.
###  [He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.] 
GRIGORY: I grant you everlasting life, youth and the power to serve me.
###  [He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation and a ritual. VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket watch. On the gold lid a SWASTIKA.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT
###  [Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.] 
###  [He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain.] 
GRIGORY: There will be no failure, General. I promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I ll deliver one.
###  [Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE. Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT
###  [The Americans fan out, unseen. Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a German foot patrol. Other GI s take up positions below a machine gun nest.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
###  [Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind him.] 
GRIGORY: Tonight, We will open a portal and awaken the OGDRU JAHAD The seven Gods of chaos. Our enemies will be destroyed. In an instant, all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise.
###  [He looks down at the machine and whispers] 
GRIGORY: Ragnarok, Anung Ia Anung.
###  [He flexes his fingers and in response the two metal rings swing around the machine s central axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from Grigory s body. Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.] 
ILSA: More Power!! Don t let the level drop!!
###  [One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it. A blade of light opens in the air! Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT
###  [The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light tears loose and flies in.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
###  [The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin. Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
###  [Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, his face distorted by ecstasy and pain. CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
###  [It s Matlin, snapping for all he s worth. Whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.] 
###  [Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT
###  [The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with the GOLD CYLINDERS.] 
BROOM: (fierce whisper, to
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
###  [Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy. Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall. The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But something else lands next to him A GRENADE!!! The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the squad of Allies storms the area. A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere. VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But Whitman s bullets rip into the old Nazi s chest. Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and grabs a grenade from his belt. TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. The steel chops clean through their weapons. Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator. CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods. Kroenen squeals and retracting his blades lunges after it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!! Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect. Another rail plunges FFFFT!!, like a javelin into the earth right next to MATLIN.] 
ILSA: Grigory!
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT
###  [Grigory s face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove, empty and smoking. As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on. Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, nothing more.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT
###  [Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.] 
MATLIN: It s almost over!!
BROOM: No. It s not.
###  [He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.] 
BROOM: Cordon off the area. Something came through.
###  [Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and hell.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT
###  [Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
###  [Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.] 
MATLIN: Do you believe in hell?
BROOM: There is a place a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight
MATLIN: Grigory That s Russian, right? Thought they were on our side
BROOM: Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin
MATLIN: C mon Rasputin??
BROOM: Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
MATLIN: That makes him more than a hundred
###  [A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, accompanied by a loud scrape. Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it. The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them] 
MATLIN: What the hell was that? An ape?
BROOM: No. It was red. Bright red.
MATLIN: A red ape.
BROOM: It s-not-an-ape
###  [They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.] 
MATLIN: It s got a big stone in its hand
BROOM: I think that is its hand.
###  [Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint. WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom stops him from firing.] 
BROOM: Wait
###  [In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna. Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED THING shrinks back. Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons around it. The creature extends its right arm it s solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the chocolate.] 
###  [Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows the RED THING climbing into Broom s arms. Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers snatch the candy. Broom smiles.] 
BROOM: It s a boy. Just a baby boy.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT
###  [The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, patting him gently. CLICK!!!] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1
MATLIN: and no one has ever seen it. They keep saying he s not real, but I want to set the record straight before I go.
###  [Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. He smiles, full of memories.] 
MATLIN: Here. The real picture, not the retouched one in LIFE magazine. This is him. The very same night we found him. The night Broom gave him that name. Can I say it on TV? He called him
----------------------------------------
# EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT
BROOM: ###  [Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.] 
###  [Montage Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc. TV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts feature the show s theme I WAS HELLBOY S BRIDE!! Some blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley. Much like Bigfoot in the woods.] 
MANNING: Look at that. That s a costume. These people amaze me.
----------------------------------------
# INT. STUDIO T.V. HOST SHOW - INTERVIEW #2 - DAY
###  [MANNING is a balding, official-looking guy in a suit.] 
MANNING: With their conveniently blurry footage of their beloved  Hellboy.  And they claim that he works for the FBI-?
###  [Manning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin.] 
MANNING: Exactly so, why is it that they re all out of focus? C mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a wedding!!

MANNING: That s the alleged best man ?

###  [In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy steps of a massive rock formation. Super BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS , EASTERN EUROPE - DAY
###  [The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they reach a DEAD END. FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and consults Grigory s LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an illustration in the book. Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, FIGURE 1 breaks through.]

# INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY
###  [The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental scale of the walkways and ramparts.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY
###  [At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin. FIGURE 3 uncovers his face he s a PEASANT GUIDE.] 
###  [FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1 throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold. TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant s chest from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward. FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in his hand. The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his blade in the snow and takes back the gold. Ilsa watches the Sherpa s blood as it runs in a steaming rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin. A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed by fireflies.] 
ILSA: Your eyes. What did they do to your eyes?
----------------------------------------
# INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
###  [Mechanized rollers transport X-Ray films over a backlit screen. A group of 4 DOCTORS studies the pictures and exchanges somber looks. Rain spatters the windows. Doctor 1 glances at the others.]

BROOM: That won t be necessary.

Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER opens the door. Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street vendor. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV s. The image of a RED, BLURRY SHAPE fills the screens.] 
BROOM: Son
MANNING: That word conceal
MANNING: Phil Phil hold your little green horses. Let me tell you and the American public one thing this  Bureau for what was it?

MYERS: John, F.B.I. Transfer from Quantico.
###  [A beat, then WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen scanner pop out.]

----------------------------------------
# INT. BROOMï¿½S OFFICE - DUSK
###  [Myers looks around, fascinated books. An office made of them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes everything in an intimate, warm light. One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to the tank.] 
###  [Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.] 
###  [In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.] 
MYERS: Jesus Christ!
###  [Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering intently. Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are bubbling.] 
MYERS: These ? You re reading these ?
###  [Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.] 
BROOM: Four books at once. Every day as long as I m here to turn the pages. My name s Broom. Professor Trevor Broom.
###  [Myers extends his hand in greeting] 
MYERS: Sir, I m
###  [BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes his eyes all three lids. Abe s voice surges from the speaker.] 
ABE: Agent John T. Myers, Kansas City, 76.  T  stands for Thaddeus, mother s older brother. Scar on your chin happened when you were ten, you still wonder if it s ever going to fade away.
MYERS: How did it
BROOM: He. Not  it.
BROOM: Abraham Sapien. Discovered alive in a secret chamber at St. Trinian s Foundling Hospital, Washington.
###  [Points at a small piece of antique paper, framed on the wall.] 
BROOM: They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
MYERS: Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
BROOM: The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence  Abe  Sapien.
###  [Broom uncovers a tray by the tank Four greenish eggs. Myers gags and reels back.] 
BROOM: Rotten eggs, a delicacy. Abe loves them.
###  [Abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing the eggs as they float through the hatch.] 
MYERS: How does he know so much about me?
BROOM: Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  Unique.  That s a word you ll hear quite a bit around here.
MYERS: Where am I exactly, Sir?
BROOM: As you entered the lobby there was an inscription
MYERS: On the desk, yes. In Latin.
BROOM: Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
MYERS: In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt
BROOM: In the absence of light, darkness prevails.  For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back.
----------------------------------------
# INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - NIGHT
###  [Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR] 
BROOM: 1937 Hitler joins  The Thule Society  a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
###  [He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.]

###  [They go through a series of pneumatic doors.] 
BROOM: In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born.
###  [Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates. Myers stares.] 
BROOM: 1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
MYERS: 1945, you mean. Hitler died in  45.
BROOM: Did he, now?
###  [They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least 4 feet high.] 
BROOM: Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead.
###  [Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.] 
MYERS: You re not coming?
###  [Broom signals  no.] 
BROOM: I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud.

MYERS: Grounded? Who s grounded?
CLAY: Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
###  [Myers nods.] 
CLAY: Well, come on in and meet the rest of the family.
###  [Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open up.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT
###  [Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. There are Zippo s everywhere, from every era. On a sofa is a heap of blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.] 
CLAY: He gets fed six times a day. He s got a thing for cats. You ll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised
MYERS: Who?!
###  [Clay points at a torn comic book HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers picks it up, looks at the cover it shows Hellboy in a U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats playfully paws at it.] 
MYERS: You re kidding
HELLBOY: Those comics They never got the eyes right.
###  [The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.] 
MYERS: Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy ?? Is real
CLAY: Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn t age like we do think dog years He s barely out of his teens.
###  [Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.] 
HELLBOY: What s with the hair, Clay?? Finally got those implants??
###  [Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.] 
CLAY: It ll fill in. Where do you want your dinner, Red? By the couch?
###  [On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears over and over an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face and raven-black hair.] 
HELLBOY: Who s the squirt?
CLAY: Agent Myers is your new liaison.
HELLBOY: Got tired of me?
CLAY: Nah. I ll be around, Red, just back in the field.
###  [BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers jumps.] 
HELLBOY: I don t want him.
CLAY: Manning says I m too soft on you The candy. Give him the candy.
###  [Myers remembers he s holding the Baby Ruths.] 
MYERS: Oh. Uh. Hello. I I have these. For you.
HELLBOY: Father s back? Still angry?
CLAY: Well, you did break out
HELLBOY: I wanted to see her. It s nobody s business.
CLAY: It is. You got yourself on TV again.
HELLBOY: Myers , huh? You have a first name??
CLAY: Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
MYERS: Uh-oh John. Staring at what?
CLAY: His horns. He files  em. To  fit in.
MYERS: His what??!!
###  [Hellboy finally enters the light. He s awe-inspiring, with chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils. In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.] 
HELLBOY: Whatcha looking at, John??
MYERS: Oh-n-no I
###  [An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers looks around, bewildered.] 
HELLBOY: Hey, hey, hey. They re playing our song.
CLAY: We re on the move.
HELLBOY: C mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You re taking me for a walk!

# EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT
###  [The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens of faces are reflected in the truck s mirrored logo. A MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT
###  [The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans. ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.] 
HELLBOY: Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
ABE: Story of my life.
HELLBOY: I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside
ABE: You mean, outside with her.
###  [Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.] 
HELLBOY: Don t get psychic with me.
ABE: Nothing psychic about it. You re easy.
###  [Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable cannon.] 
HELLBOY: How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
ABE: Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
HELLBOY: We don t take hints.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
###  [The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops. FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed cops and securing the doors. THREE AGENTS QUARRY, STONE and MOSS close a gate, sealing off the area.] 
###  [From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.] 
CLAY: Seal the doors. Red and Blue are coming in.
###  [The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing HELLBOY and ABE.] 
CLAY: Okay, boys, let s synch up our locators.

CLAY: At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead
HELLBOY: Hold on hold on I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
BROOM: Apparently not everything was fake.
###  [Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.] 
HELLBOY: Father ?

----------------------------------------
# INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY  - NIGHT
###  [They approach an oversize set of brass doors. Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids and concentrates. Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of bullets of all colors and shapes.] 
BROOM: A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
HELLBOY: Who wards off demons.
BROOM: Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow
HELLBOY: Reliquary
BROOM: A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
###  [Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.] 
HELLBOY: Would ya look at this babies? Made  em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak the works.
ABE: Behind this door. A dark entity Evil, ancient and hungry.
###  [Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of ancient magic.] 
HELLBOY: Oh, well. Lemme go in and say  hi .
###  [As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow illuminates him. He steps inside.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
###  [BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen display case. He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and statues startle him. On the floor boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats.] 
HELLBOY: Blue It stinks in here Finely aged roadkill.
###  [The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to discover A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. SAMMAEL equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, but the jaws are shiny with blood.] 
HELLBOY: Hey. Stinky. Kitchen s closed. Whatcha havin ? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you re gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out
ABE: Red, I found something
----------------------------------------
# INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY  - NIGHT

ABE: There s not much here the entity s name is Sammael, the desolate one, son of Nergal
----------------------------------------
# INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT
###  [Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the neck is exposed white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble and criss- crossed with blue veins.] 
HELLBOY: Hold it Hey, Sammy, whaddayasay we work this out?? Peacefully. I m not a great shot, but  The Samaritan  here, uses really big bullets, so whadyasay we work this out?
###  [Sammael stands and turns around CRACK-KKK!!! His waist twists him 360 degrees!! Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!! Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it grows still.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT
HELLBOY: That s all for you, Sammy.
###  [Hellboy turns away for a moment. Puts his gun away, like a gunslinger.] 
HELLBOY: Nah he s taken care of.

----------------------------------------
# INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT
###  [The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy s impact. Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this, pleased.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT
###  [Sammael lashes out with a massive punch. HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass cabinets, then hits a window, falling] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
###  [two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his mouth] 
###  [Hellboy looks up standing in the alley, like an apparition, is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded by pitch-black sunglasses] 
GRIGORY: All grown up, I see.
###  [Hellboy s in shock, confused.] 
HELLBOY: That voice
GRIGORY: I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world. I alone know your true calling, your true name.
HELLBOY: Don t tell me, it s Zeppo.
###  [Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.] 
GRIGORY: I can see that you re still young and don t know your place. Teach him.
###  [Before Hellboy can reach the weapon WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael s mouth like a whip. It s arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from its sides. It wraps around Hellboy s right arm. Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy s skin.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
###  [Then BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the alley, firing round after round into Sammael s tongue. AMBER BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal] 
###  [Hellboy manages to roll away. Myers goes for HELLBOY s gun and grabs it! He takes cover behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.] 
HELLBOY: What do you think you re doing??
###  [Myers proudly shows him the gun.] 
MYERS: Helping you I just
HELLBOY: No one ever helps me. It s my job.
###  [He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too much.] 
HELLBOY: Damn Okay. Here
###  [He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.] 
HELLBOY: Then load this.
###  [In the packet A SINGLE BULLET.] 
HELLBOY: It s a tracking bullet. Crack the pin. Load it.
###  [KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. Again and again Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it. Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows like a chemical flare.] 
MYERS: Jeez What the hell is that?
###  [He s looking at Hellboy s smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, a big, black stinger is gleaming. Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe grape.] 
HELLBOY: Lemme go ask
###  [Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael s tongue instantly wraps around the gun s muzzle. BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then] 
###  [The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ALLEY
###  [Sammael, still in mid-air. It hits him square in the chest an explosion of green goo!! With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles after it.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT
###  [On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP. He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.] 
MYERS: Wait! No, what are you doing?
###  [Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full tilt. A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.] 
###  [Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area. A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch. Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick- or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON. Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer s roof.] 
###  [Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver s cab] 
###  [The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, showered by thousands of glass shards. Myers is a few steps behind.] 
MYERS: We ll hit the street in a minute. We re heading towards civilians
###  [He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The vendors are yelling at him.] 
MYERS: Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick or treat!!
----------------------------------------
# EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
###  [Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR TREATERS scream. Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as Myers follows He runs into the road and a 4X4 speeds straight at him! Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks. The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints. Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major traffic jam.] 
HELLBOY: Are you okay?
###  [Myers opens his eyes, nods.] 
HELLBOY: Good. Stay here.
###  [He moves after Sammael.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael s gone. He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.]

###  [He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. Seated.] 
HELLBOY: Waiting for me, Sammy?
###  [A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles and puts away his gun.] 
HELLBOY: Uh-oh between a rock and a hard place
###  [But Sammael sprints towards it!] 
HELLBOY: Aw, crap
###  [Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, then jumps at the front car]

----------------------------------------
# INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT
###  [Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode everywhere. The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming it against Hellboy s head.] 
HELLBOY: Hey! Hey! I m on your side!!
###  [BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR
###  [The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He follows it, until it ends abruptly. He looks ahead no trace of Sammael Then a fat drop of glowing goop hits his hand.] 
HELLBOY: Aw, I forgot
###  [He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug. Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex. Sammael staggers back and in an impossible maneuver, re- knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to tackle Hellboy and TCHAKKKK!! pin his shoulder down. A deep wound. Sammael s mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking THIRD RAIL a few feet away. Sammael s tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.] 
HELLBOY: Screw you.
###  [Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael very crispy is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still. Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar.] 
HELLBOY: I m fireproof. You weren t.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
###  [A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses. Myers his arm freshly bandaged signs a police form. His radio beeps.]

----------------------------------------
# INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT
###  [An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. Kroenen stands next to it. ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She stands over Grigory his back to us lovingly shaving her master s scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. Places them in Grigory s sockets his back to us as he turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his hand in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael s body. He cradles it like a precious stone.] 
GRIGORY: Sammael has fulfilled his destiny Die in peace and be reborn again and again
###  [He closes his fist.] 
ILSA: Only seven more days to the eclipse, Grishka
###  [Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in fascination.] 
GRIGORY: The child will be there. And so will we all Won t we?
###  [Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel TWO SAMMAEL silhouettes appear.]

# EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
###  [A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside. FBI agent MANNING emerges.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT
###  [Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning up. The dead guards are carried out.] 
MANNING: Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I m running out of lies, Trevor.
BROOM: I thought you liked being on TV.
MANNING: I do. How many escapes? This year alone five!
BROOM: Tom he s our guest, not a prisoner.
MANNING: Your  guest  happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
BROOM: He s just going through a phase
###  [Manning moistens and lights a fine cigar, using a kitchen match.] 
MANNING: A  phase ? What do you think this is,  The Brady Bunch?  These freaks
###  [ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm open.] 
MANNING: These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I m not the only one. You re up for review. You and your petting zoo.
BROOM: I know where to find him. I ll get him back.
###  [Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the floor.] 
MANNING: Hey, fishstick don t touch anything
###  [Abe silences him.] 
ABE: I need to touch it to  see
MANNING: See what??
ABE: The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
MANNING: Is he serious??
ABE: Don t worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
###  [Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.] 
ABE: They were over here, Professor.
MANNING: Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
###  [Broom examines the dagger a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt. The dragon and swastika.] 
BROOM: Show me, Abe show me.
###  [He solemnly extends his hand. As soon as Abe takes it, the room] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK
###  [Hours earlier the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness spectrally as A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking sound, he shines his light into a dark corner no one s there. But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from the pool of shadows on the floor. It s KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly ticking gears. He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT. Then, on the glass, a reflection ILSA.] 
ILSA: Move.
###  [She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case. The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on. Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a giant bone saw, slicing across the statue. No apparent damage until CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears and the top half falls. KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and winds himself up. Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand. Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns at Kroenen.] 
###  [Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two] 
###  [bullet tears into Kroenen s arm, spewing forth an explosion of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers the steel, deflecting the bullets which ricochet wildly and finally hit three of the guards. They fall silently to the floor. Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives. The last guard raises his gun.] 
###  [Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted by an unseen force!! The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible force. He starts floating in mid-air. The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding an imaginary doll. His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, gaining strength. With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guard s body in opposite directions. With a wet CRUNCH, the guard s shadow on the wall goes limp. Grigory looks at Ilsa.] 
GRIGORY: Ready the welcome, my love
###  [Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor.] 
GRIGORY: Salt. Gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs. Restraining the essence of Sammael, the hell hound, the seed of destruction.
###  [Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting glyphs and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle. Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together,] 
###  [It roars!!!] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT
###  [Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions for the others to stay back. He extends his open palm and  feels  the air near the old man s back.] 
ABE: Professor..? You are very sick
BROOM: I don t want Hellboy to know
###  [Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe s hand away.] 
BROOM: Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job.
----------------------------------------
# EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
###  [A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music on picnic tables. On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack. Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
###  [Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a brick 1940 s HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack-o -lanterns. A topiary garden surrounds the building. Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail THE SIX PACK OF BEER.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
###  [DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills. Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient s gown carries the medicine tray. This is Liz_Sherman, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands circle her wrist. Near a window, a Down s Syndrome PATIENT senses something.] 
###  [Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below seems empty.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT
###  [Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging from her neck an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it] 
LIZ: Back so soon?
###  [Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy s overcoat. His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.] 
HELLBOY: Uh, I brought beer.
###  [Liz shoots a Polaroid.] 
LIZ: To wash down my lithium pills? I may get a few perks, H.B. But I m still a patient.
###  [Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.] 
LIZ: You better have that looked at.
HELLBOY: Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.
###  [Liz sighs.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT
###  [Hellboy s sitting on a bench, next to Liz.] 
HELLBOY: We miss you at the Bureau. Abe s crazier every day. And Father s still mad at me Come back, Liz. Come back. I
LIZ: No. Not this time, H.B. It s been months since I ve had an episode. And you know what? I m learning to control it.
###  [Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at the pale flame.] 
LIZ: I m learning where it comes from. And for once in my life I m not afraid.
###  [She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.] 
LIZ: Looks like your ride is here.
###  [The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the vehicles.] 
HELLBOY: The Nanny Squad.
###  [Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns to Broom] 
MYERS: Sir, may I go first??
CLAY: Not so fast. He barely knows him
BROOM: Then he should make it his business to change that.
###  [Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.] 
LIZ: Listen, H.B. I ve got a chance out here. If you truly care about me, don t come back anymore.
###  [Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.] 
HELLBOY: Goodnight, then.
LIZ: Goodnight.
###  [She doesn t turn back.] 
HELLBOY: Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do
###  [Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his feet, a pool of his own blood. He sees Myers tentatively approaching.] 
HELLBOY: What took you so long?
MYERS: C mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
HELLBOY: What are you, a Boy Scout?
MYERS: No. I never was.
HELLBOY: Could ve fooled me. Go away.
###  [Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. Help him up.] 
CLAY: C mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
HELLBOY: This ? This is nothing. You know what ll kill me? Her.
###  [Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. A few of the agents help him to the vehicles. Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others  gaze, their unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes inside.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT
###  [In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him. Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy s wounded arm.] 
ABE: You were burned by some organic acid.
HELLBOY: I m lucky that way.
###  [Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a] 
BROOM: Son. About Rasputin
HELLBOY: Don t worry. I ll get him soon enough
BROOM: Listen to me. This time is different. There s more at stake than ever before.

HELLBOY: I dunno, maybe five seconds ow!
MYERS: You want me to hold him down?
HELLBOY: That s right, Stud, hold me down.
ABE: Professor
###  [Broom moves to Abe s side of the table. Abe is poking at the depths of the wound.] 
BROOM: Don t look! Turn around.
HELLBOY: Is it bad?
###  [Broom comes closer, eyes wide inside the wound on Hellboy s forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS. Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits it in a glass container.] 
ABE: Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
HELLBOY: Didn t even buy me a drink.
----------------------------------------
# INT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER
###  [The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.] 
ABE: The eggs are very sensitive to heat and light. They need a humid, dark environment to breed.
###  [Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.] 
MYERS: Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
HELLBOY: Well, let s see there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head
###  [Broom frowns, worried.] 
BROOM: We can t risk it You ll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom.
###  [Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal THING wiggles.]

MYERS: I m in way over my head, I know that much.
BROOM: You re doing fine.
###  [At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting in the shadows near the door.] 
MYERS: No, I m not. He respects Clay. Not me. I don t know why you chose me, Sir. But I m not qualified.
###  [Discouraged, Myers heads for the door.] 
BROOM: I m dying Agent Myers.
###  [Shocked, Myers looks over at Broom.] 
BROOM: And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there s often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart
MYERS: Oh, please. I m not  pure of heart.

A caption reads ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots one at the lens.] 
LIZ: I don t like the term  firestarter.  I just don t. And  Pyrokinesis  sounds like psychosis or something. I dunno maybe that s right. Not being able to let go Scary. Sometimes you hear so-and-so lost control and just exploded. They re lucky it isn t true. With me it is.

# INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT
###  [A flashlight beam sweeps Liz s room. It illuminates a CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes of everyday life. When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, still asleep. As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the bed, extending his right hand.] 
GRIGORY: The Master is calling your name now, my girl. We are all part of his plan. You must return to the child So, once again
###  [He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His fingers start to glow.] 
GRIGORY: dream of fire.
###  [Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY
###  [Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement courtyard.] 
###  [Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest. A WOMAN Liz s MOTHER comes down the courtyard steps, carrying a basket of apples.] 
###  [Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated apples three KIDS giggle and point at her.] 
###  [Liz turns to see them.] 
###  [Liz shies away from them.] 
###  [They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder. Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash. A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz s hands. Soon a pale blue flame rings her entire arm.] 
LIZ: Not again, please, not again
###  [Firelight glints off the crucifix.]

###  [devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball. The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one figure left standing Liz a little girl, still crying.]

# INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

HELLBOY: How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
BROOM: That s not how she feels. She may never feel it.
###  [Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore him.] 
BROOM: It s her choice She s human
HELLBOY: Oh, as opposed to ?
###  [Broom grows silent. Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and using a hand-held belt sander savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps.] 
HELLBOY: Mmmh  Pamcakes.  We re going out
MYERS: Professor, that girl you were talking about
HELLBOY: Hey. You think twice
MYERS: I think I can help Talk to her I can bring her back.
HELLBOY: What landed you this job, pushing  pamcakes ? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?

LIZ: Doesn t sounds like him.
MYERS: Miss Sherman, he s asking you back, but it s entirely your choice.

----------------------------------------
# INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY
###  [They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase encourages them to behave like men.] 
QUARRY: We re in the cellar of the Benjamin Institute. Turn-of-the-century orphanage. Closed since they moved the sewers in  51.

----------------------------------------
# INT.  FURNACE ROOM - DAY
###  [Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING. At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand his own. His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw gums and taut skin. As Hellboy s pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles blindly on the table. He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY
###  [The wall collapses under Hellboy s attack.]

# INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM  - DAY

HELLBOY: There you go, Doctor. This should cover your tailfin On loan from the Vatican, a bone from Saint Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.
###  [Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.] 
ABE: Remind me why I keep doing this.

###  [As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 -  - DAY
###  [Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940 s magazines float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM  - DAY
###  [Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. Finds a pile of children s shoes covering some yellowing albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans from the past. Some of the faces have been cut out. There s an unfinished letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866. Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror.] 
CLAY: See? It s thicker. Isn t it? It s not that doll-hair thing
###  [Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer caught in headlights.] 
HELLBOY: Son of a !
###  [The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.] 
CLAY: Red, wait!

----------------------------------------
# INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH  - DAY
###  [Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow of Hellboy s flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.] 
CLAY: Damn it, Red.
----------------------------------------
# INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2  - DAY
###  [Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent egg! Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns sees nothing. He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one. Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines. Abe s reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It lands on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!! The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure. Sammael can t fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to reach deeper, screaming in rage. Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.]

HELLBOY: Sammael seed of destruction. Death becomes the fertile ground.
###  [Suddenly drool drops from above Sammael hangs from a beam.] 
HELLBOY: Didn t I kill you already?
###  [Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service shaft and it s a long way down. When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, however, grabs Hellboy s tail and pulls him over the side.]

# INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY
###  [A subway platform. Full of people. The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth in an explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change. The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform floor. Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of turnstiles, uprooting them all. Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses the tip imbeds itself in the floor and then TCHAKKK!!! in a concrete column. Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS from the fleeing public. A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant. Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy s stone hand emerges, triumphant.] 
HELLBOY: Hey, Chunk-face!
###  [He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.] 
HELLBOY: You can do better than that. Big monster like you.
###  [Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael again and again.] 
HELLBOY: See? It hurts! You shouldn t hit people!
###  [Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds itself in the tile wall. Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut. Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, scraping a jagged line with his stone hand. He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a wooden bench, breaking it in two. Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine. Hellboy gets up his back bristling with glass shards and hears a WAIL a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS abandoned on a bench.] 
HELLBOY: Aw, crap.
###  [Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench. Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking citizens. Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, blood dripping from his forehead and nose. Hellboy starts to reload, but Sammael s tongue shoots out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and traps the tongue with his stone hand] 
HELLBOY: Second date. No tongue!!
###  [while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are fine. Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window. Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged glass. Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel. Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems lost, when WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight for Sammael. It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. Sammael s body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.]

QUARRY: Abe
###  [Suddenly a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their flashlights over the columns Nothing there.] 
QUARRY: Moss, what the hell was that?
###  [Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps. Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. Useless the things plow on. Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few seconds, a green light beeps, READY. The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of fire into the blackness. The men pause silence! Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.] 
QUARRY: Whatever it was
###  [BAM!!! SAMMAEL S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands on Quarry s face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully squeezes Quarry. The man s screams are muffled by the creature s fleshy lips wrapping around his head. Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss s back, breaking his spine.]

A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place. SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if in a trance.] 
###  [Hellboy turns, Manning is there] 
MANNING: But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents died today. Clay probably won t survive the night. You re reckless.
HELLBOY: I knew those men better than you did
MANNING: Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
###  [He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.]

LIZ: It s only for the weekend, Professor Broom. Then I ll be on my way
BROOM: Come and go as you please. Find your way back. We ve made quite a few changes

MANNING: I want that thing locked up, starting now Now!!! You hear me??!!

HELLBOY: Um Liz I there s something I d like you to something I need you to hear.

HELLBOY: Sorry. Just couldn t leave you two alone.
###  [Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz. Lit by Myers  flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One clamps onto Hellboy s back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back. Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a Sammael. Two eggs glow two new Sammaels are born. They re FIVE. Hellboy s torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy is in trouble. Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her body.] 
LIZ: Hit me.
MYERS: What?
###  [Liz is desperate, crying.] 
LIZ: Hit me All of my life I ve run away from it Now I want it to happen! Do it.
###  [Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.] 
MYERS: I can t, I
###  [Liz slaps him.] 
LIZ: I know now I love him. I ve always loved him.
###  [A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal s.] 
LIZ: Go now.
###  [Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz s arms blaze with fire. The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce. On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter s gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees Liz s body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.] 
HELLBOY: Liz
###  [The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands. The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY
###  [The screen FADES TO WHITE and then Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat. Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, on her side, unconscious. Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, Hellboy turns around In the eerie silence of his deafness, he sees Grigory LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd comedy. Ilsa approaches. And in a simple, brutal move hits him with a hammer] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings a large church- like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar. Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from Lapikov. Liz lies at Grigory s feet. He s dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.] 
GRIGORY: And I looked and beheld an Angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit
###  [Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn t bend.] 
GRIGORY: These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the door Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.
ILSA: You are the key! The right hand of doom!
###  [Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS] 
ILSA: What did you think it was made for? Open the locks.
###  [Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first time.] 
MYERS: Don t do it!! Don t do it!!
###  [Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.] 
ILSA: Silence!!
###  [The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. The altar s clockworks monitors its progress.] 
ILSA: Imagine it An eden for you and her
HELLBOY: No.
###  [Grigory turns to Hellboy.] 
GRIGORY: No? In exchange for her life then, open the door.
###  [In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head no.] 
GRIGORY: As you wish.
###  [He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear Her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. Then she goes limp.] 
GRIGORY: She s dead.
HELLBOY: Noooo! Noooo!!!
###  [He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the eclipse.] 
GRIGORY: Her soul awaits on the other side. If you want her back Open the door and claim her.
###  [His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. Can t find one the moon is almost totally eclipsed. He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.] 
HELLBOY: For her.
###  [Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. It lands near Myers.] 
GRIGORY: Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin  The crossroads.  And crossroads I have become. Your true name Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
HELLBOY: Anung-un-Rama
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy s stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winter s night. Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian.] 
MYERS: No!! Don t do it!! Listen to me!!
###  [HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on the stone slab CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock. A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT
###  [Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it s more intense, with ripples and haloes.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
###  [Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. The ruby beam pierces the darkness.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place a burning glyph. Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his skin, but he manages to free one hand.] 
----------------------------------------
# EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT
###  [OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the frame.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He turns it. Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. THE SKY - NIGHT
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.] 
GRIGORY: The final seal. Open it!
###  [Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers her full in the face. She staggers back and down.] 
MYERS: Remember who you are!!!
###  [He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy catches it. It smokes in his hand. He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts. Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory. With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the stumps. He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn. The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken. Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended. Grigory crumples in agony. The burning glyphs in Hellboy s stone hand dim down, his features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.] 
GRIGORY: You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
HELLBOY: I can live with that.
###  [He breaks Myers  chains, helps him up.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy painfully takes Liz s limp body in his arms. Myers stands by his side. He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down the steps. Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot A smashed GLASS EYE. Then out of the silence, a WHISPER.] 
GRIGORY: Child
###  [Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.] 
GRIGORY: Look what you ve done
###  [He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift lazily.] 
GRIGORY: You ve killed me an insignificant man but you have brought forth a God.
###  [He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out of the wound, like intestines. A large entity erupts from Grigory s torso and claws the air.] 
GRIGORY: Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.
###  [Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape BABY BEHEMOTH lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by the second. Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory s corpse. Kisses him on the mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.] 
ILSA: Hell will hold no surprises for us.
###  [A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT
###  [In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz s body over to Myers.] 
HELLBOY: Keep her safe. No matter what. I ll deal with whatever s back there.
MYERS: Alone?
HELLBOY: How big can it be?
###  [As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash onto HELLBOYï¿½S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, finally confronting] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house Hellboy head smoking writhes in the grip of the tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling. As he arcs back down, ABM!! he cracks the floor wide open. Next to him the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way. The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding cogwheels and gears. Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble statue. Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he s worth. FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the floor, rolling into the crack. From out of Behemoth s stump a mass of wriggling tentacles replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy s face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward. He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, onto the first ledge. It crumbles!! The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide away. A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, he grabs the belts with his tail. The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever seen. Hellboy s tail passes him the belts. The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts Useless.] 
HELLBOY: They never work
###  [He wraps them around his stone arm.] 
HELLBOY: Ugh Now, this is gonna hurt
###  [He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him into a squid-like beak and gulps him down. After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature s innards. Then] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy organs. The creature starts to burn.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh. Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!! With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.] 
----------------------------------------
# INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT
###  [Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light ripple over the ground.] 
HELLBOY: Ouch It did hurt.
----------------------------------------
# INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL
###  [Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully drags himself over. Liz s body is on the floor. Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz s head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest and whispers in her ear. A beat or two, then a moan.] 
LIZ: In the dark I heard your voice What did you say ?
###  [He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.] 
HELLBOY: You, on the other side let her go. Because for her, for her I ll die. I ll cross over.   And you ll be sorry I did.
###  [Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as what he is the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her body. Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated by the flames. Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom Waits  CINNY S WALTZ fills the air.]
